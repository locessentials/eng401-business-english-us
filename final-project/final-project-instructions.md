## Final Presentation on Teams

Along with delivering all project files, you'll need share your presentation on Teams in the `Final Projects` channel. Share a link to your recorded presentation along with brief description on what it's about. Your Teams post should follow this template:

```
Subject: Title of Your Presentation
Presenters: List the names of the presenters
Description: Give a 1-2 sentence description of the presentation
Top "why to watch" reason: Tell us one reason we should watch your presentation

Link: Include a link to your presentation

```

**Tips to Follow When Posting**
- Remember to adjust the sharing settings so that your link is actually accessible.
- Only one post is needed per team, though team members are welcome to weigh in within the comments with thoughts they'd like to share on their presentation.
- It's optional, but you're encouraged to comment upon one another's posts with specific feedback on areas for improvement and elements that were done particularly well.

Please zip all of these files together into a package called `LastNames_FinalProject.zip` and deliver this to the assignment on Teams.
One delivery per team please!

### Organizing Your Work
Throughout your career, you will produce a lot of data. That said, being disciplined and establishing good file naming conventions are great practices to develop.

├── Research_Sources/
    └── [organized research materials]

    └── [just the files you'll deliver for this class zipped together]
```
