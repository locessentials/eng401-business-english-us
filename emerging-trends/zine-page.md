# Emerging Trends Zine

The **TR35 Business English Emerging Trends Zine** is a student-created publication that challenges conventional business thinking and imagines alternative futures for work, innovation, and technology.

As part of their Partial Exam 3, students contribute creative pieces—blackout poetry, manifestos, speculative scenarios, visual art, and more—that critically examine business buzzwords like "digital transformation," "disruption," and "innovation." Rather than accepting these terms at face value, contributors explore what they really mean, who they serve, and what alternative futures might look like.

This project is inspired by the Distributed AI Research Institute's [Imagining Possible Futures](https://www.dair-institute.org/imagining-possible-futures) workshop and zine, which invited participants to envision technological futures beyond dominant corporate narratives. Our zine brings this approach to business education, encouraging students to question assumptions and propose transformative alternatives.

## How to Contribute

### Students Taking TR35

If you're currently enrolled in TR35 Business English, you'll contribute to the zine as part of Week 15's coursework. Your contribution—whether blackout poetry, manifesto, speculative scenario, or another creative format—will be compiled with your classmates' work into a new zine issue.

**See the full assignment:** [Emerging Business Trends Zine Assignment](../unit5/week15/emerging-business-trends-zine-assignment.md)

**Editors needed:** Each semester, we seek 2-3 student volunteers to serve as zine editors. Editors compile contributions, design the cover, and make editorial decisions about presentation. This role offers extra credit and recognition as a named editor on the publication.

### Instructors

If you're teaching a business communication, translation, or related course and want to create a zine with your students, you're welcome to adapt our assignment and share the results.

**To contribute your class's zine:**
1. Fork our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II)
2. Add your zine issue to the `emerging-trends/issues/` folder
3. Submit a pull request with your contribution

All submissions are subject to quality review to ensure they align with the zine's critical, creative approach to business innovation.

### Individual Contributors

Have you written something that fits the zine's theme? We welcome standalone pieces that critically examine business trends, imagine alternative futures, or challenge dominant narratives about innovation and work.

**Individual contributions may be published as special releases** if they demonstrate:
- Critical thinking about business buzzwords and emerging trends
- Substantive engagement with the themes of transformation, innovation, or future of work
- Creative format or perspective
- Publication-ready quality

To propose an individual contribution, contact the course instructor through the GitHub repository.
