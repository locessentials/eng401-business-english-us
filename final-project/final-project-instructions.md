# Final Project Instructions

## Overview

Working in a small group, you will select a subtopic within "The Job Search," research it thoroughly, create a professional presentation, write a detailed report, and record your presentation delivery. You may also invite peer evaluations of your work or participate in peer evaluation activities if enrolled in a formal course.

## Success Mindset

Approach this project with the mindset of a business professional presenting to real stakeholders. Ask yourself:

- **Relevance:** Does my topic address current business challenges?
- **Credibility:** Do my sources and analysis demonstrate professional competency?
- **Clarity:** Can my audience understand and act on my recommendations?

- Establish clear communication methods and meeting schedules early
- Designate roles for coordination, research, and quality assurance

#### Subtopic Selection

Your group will select one subtopic within the broader theme of **"The Job Search"** for in-depth exploration. This focus ensures that your research directly addresses practical challenges you'll face as you transition into professional roles in translation, localization, and related fields.

**Available Subtopics:**

| Subtopic | Focus Areas |

| **Establishing Your Professional Presence** | LinkedIn optimization, personal websites, professional associations, content strategies, demonstrating expertise |
| **Custom Topics** | Other job search-related topics with instructor approval |

#### Subtopic Selection Criteria
Your chosen subtopic should:
- **Address immediate needs** of students entering the professional job market
- **Support substantial research** with access to 5-8 credible sources
- **Enable practical recommendations** that your cohort can apply
- **Leverage group strengths** and diverse perspectives effectively
- **Suit visual presentation** with opportunities for engaging slide design

#### Submission Requirements
