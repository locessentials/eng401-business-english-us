# Professional Development Training Example

Welcome to the First-Time Managers Training Academy! You've been identified as key performers who would make great managers. We're here to help you to suceed on your journey. This training exercise for first-time managers will help you get experience with one-on-one's and employeee development planning conversations.

Working in partners, take turns being the manager and the employee discussing career goals. Start with the general one-on-one conversation, in which you work through the Rose, Thorn, Bud framework for kicking off conversations. Then move on to designing each of your performance development plans for addressing a business challenge that's important to you. Finally, brainstorm together about common performance issues, so that you can develop the ability to respond empathetically to those issues.

## One-on-One Conversations

### What to Watch

Watch these videos and then proceed through the one-on-one agenda.

### One-on-One Agenda

**If you are playing the employee,** respond to these agenda items:

| What to share... | Description | 
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| **Rose** | Per Jeff Su: "A win you experienced since the last time you two had a chat. Does not have to be a 'big' win, just needs to start the meeting on a positive note" |
| **Thorn** | Per Jeff Su: "A challenge you've recently encountered and might need more support on" |
| **Bud** | Per Jeff Su: "A new idea you have or something you want to learn more about and you want your manager's input" |

Remember, providing a great deal of detail may not necessarily help your manager give better recommendations. Try to be targeted when answering these questions.

**If you are playing the manager:**

- Listen attentively.
- Ask questions that will help the person to think through potential solutions to issues they are encountering.
- Offer suggestions about gaps in thinking that may be preventing the person from moving forward in their work.
- Recognize when the person just needs to vent, and you need to take no action.
- Suggest and offer resources that may help the person.
- Offer encouragement.
- Ask for feedback.
- Make plans to follow up.

Remember, providing effective feedback sometimes relies on listening more, speaking less, and helping a person come to their own conclusions about work matters.

## Performance Development Plan

Following [D2L's Employee Development Plans](https://www.d2l.com/blog/employee-development-plan), quickly design a [SMART system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) for addressing a business challenge you'd like to solve. Design your system based on the following format from D2L.

### D2L Employee Development Plan Framework

| Plan category | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Plan category | What would you give as a short subject line to the challenge? |
| Your role | Who are you, and what is your relationship to the challenge? |
| Business challenge | What is the business challenge you'd like to solve? | 
| Manager readiness check | What do you need to know to be able to do that?<br>What preparation do you need to do to address the challenge? |
| Development within work priorities | How can you develop the capacity to address the challenge within the work you're already doing? |
| Continuous feedback loop | How will you get continuous feedback about your improvement? |
| Competing-priority-proof accountability | What are ways of making the skills development you need to do actionable, given than you have many competing priorities? |

## Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)

### What to Watch

Watch this video and then proceed through the PIP agenda.

- [JAN Role-Play Training Series: Performance Management](https://youtu.be/0LpQjI_8mQI?si=sD1AJpj_0DWZOeku) - A role play on open and honest communication leading to performance improvements for both managers and employees

### PIP Agenda

Your final activity in partners is to brainstorm answers together to questions around common performance issues. Pick an issue that interests you, and respond together to these questions.

- What is a common area for improvement that you would like to understand better, such as tardiness, late delivery of work, problems with communication? Why?
- How does understanding the issue help you to be a better employee or manager?
- What do the stakeholders need to know to respond to the issue? (Circumstances and policies, for instance)
- What help can be provided to each of the stakeholders to help them to respond to the issue?
- What communication structures and rules should be put in place to support everyone's improvement in this area, if any?
