# Quality Improvement Plan Assignment

**Worth:** 3 points

**Format:** Individual or group work

## Overview

Throughout this week, you have explored quality management systems, the concept of non-conforming outputs, and the systematic approaches organizations use to address quality issues. You've learned about the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle, studied root cause analysis techniques including the 5 Whys and Fishbone diagrams, and examined how corrective and preventive actions work together to drive continuous quality improvement.

Now you'll apply this knowledge by investigating a real or hypothetical quality failure and developing a comprehensive quality improvement plan. This assignment simulates the critical work quality managers do when non-conforming outputs are identified: documenting the problem, conducting thorough root cause analysis, implementing corrective actions to fix the immediate issue, and establishing preventive actions to ensure the problem never recurs.

Your quality improvement plan will demonstrate how systematic quality management transforms quality failures into opportunities for organizational learning and process improvement.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Analyze non-conforming outputs and clearly articulate how they failed to meet specifications
- Conduct root cause analysis using recognized methodologies to identify the true sources of quality issues
- Distinguish between corrective actions (fixing current problems) and preventive actions (preventing future problems)
- Develop professional quality management documentation that supports continuous improvement initiatives
- Demonstrate understanding of how quality issues often originate upstream from where they manifest

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Form your team and select a quality failure scenario

You may work individually or in groups of up to **3 people**. Working in a team allows you to discuss different perspectives on root causes and develop more comprehensive corrective and preventive action plans.

**Select a quality failure** for which you'll develop your quality improvement plan. You have two options:

#### Option A: Research a Real Quality Failure
Identify a documented quality failure from any industry. This could be:
- A product recall or safety issue
- A localization or translation error that made news
- A service delivery failure at a company
- A software release with critical bugs
- A manufacturing defect that affected customers
- A business communication error with significant consequences

**Research guidelines:**
- Choose a case with sufficient public information to understand what went wrong
- Look for cases where you can identify both the immediate problem and potential upstream causes
- Ensure you can find credible sources to cite (news articles, company statements, industry reports)

#### Option B: Create a Realistic Hypothetical Scenario
Develop a realistic quality failure scenario based on your understanding of an industry. This could be:
- A translation/localization project with significant quality issues
- A product launch with specification mismatches
- A service delivery failure due to process gaps
- A project that went significantly over time or budget due to quality problems

**Scenario development guidelines:**
- Make it realistic and detailed enough to conduct meaningful root cause analysis
- Include specific details about what was expected versus what was delivered
- Consider quality failures you've witnessed or could plausibly occur in your field of interest
- Draw from your experience or knowledge of industry standards

**Important:** Review the [Quality Improvement Plan Example: Pokémon Scarlet & Violet](quality-improvement-example.md) to see how quality failures are documented and analyzed at a professional level.

### Step 2: Research quality standards and root cause analysis

Before developing your plan, research:
- What quality standards or specifications should have been met in your scenario?
- What root cause analysis method will work best for your case? (5 Whys, Fishbone, or another RCA technique)
- What are industry best practices for preventing similar quality issues?
- If using a real case, what did the organization actually do in response?

### Step 3: Develop your Quality Improvement Plan

Your plan must include the following sections:

#### Required Section 1: Title and Description of the Issue

**Title:** Give your quality improvement plan a clear, descriptive title that identifies the product/service and the issue
- Example: "Quality Improvement Plan: Mobile App Language Selector Malfunction"
- Example: "Quality Improvement Plan: Product Manual Translation Inconsistencies"

**Contributors:** List all team members who contributed to the plan

**Description of the Issue:** Write a comprehensive description (2-3 paragraphs) that explains:
- What product or service had the quality issue
- When and how the non-conforming output was identified
- What specifically was wrong with the output (be concrete and detailed)
- What impact the quality issue had (customer complaints, safety concerns, financial losses, reputation damage, etc.)

**Note:** Use the "Non-Conforming Output - Description" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model.

#### Required Section 2: Product Specifications

Clearly document what should have been delivered versus what was actually delivered. This section must include:

**What should have been delivered:**
- Specific quality standards that should have been met
- Technical specifications, accuracy requirements, or performance standards
- Relevant regulations, certifications, or compliance requirements
- Timeline or resource constraints that were part of the specifications

**What was actually delivered:**
- Specific ways the output failed to meet specifications
- Quantifiable differences where possible (error counts, time delays, performance metrics)
- Evidence of the non-conformity

**Note:** Use the "Product Specifications" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model.

#### Required Section 3: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to identify why the non-conformity occurred. Your RCA section must include:

**Which RCA method you used:**
- State clearly whether you used 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, or another recognized RCA technique
- Briefly explain why you chose this method for your particular case

**Your analysis:**
- For 5 Whys: Present your complete chain of questioning, showing how each "why" led to the next until you reached root causes
- For Fishbone: Include a visual diagram showing the different categories of causes you examined, OR describe your analysis process if you cannot include a visual
- For other methods: Clearly show your analytical process

**Identified root causes:**
- Create a table documenting all root causes you identified
- Each root cause should include: Root Cause ID, Description, and Category (Planning/Resources/Process/Communication/Training/etc.)
- Include at least **3 distinct root causes**

**Note:** Use the "Root Cause Analysis" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model. Notice how the example shows both the 5 Whys analysis AND the summary table of root causes.

#### Required Section 4: Corrective Action

Document the actions taken or that should be taken to fix the immediate problem and prevent recurrence in current/recent projects. Include:

**Immediate response:**
- What decision was made about the non-conforming output? (Start from scratch? Rework? Use as is?)
- What immediate actions were taken to address customer impact?

**Process corrections:**
- Create a table with at least **3 corrective actions**
- For each action include: Action ID, Corrective Action Description, Responsible Party, Timeline, and Status (if applicable)

**Note:** Corrective actions are reactive—they address problems that have already occurred. Use the "Corrective Action" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model.

#### Required Section 5: Preventive Action

Document the systemic changes implemented or that should be implemented to prevent similar issues from occurring in future projects. Include:

**Preventive action plan:**
- Create a table with at least **5 preventive actions**
- For each action include: Action ID, Preventive Action Description, Responsible Party, and Status (if applicable)
- Focus on systemic improvements: process changes, training, documentation updates, tool improvements, quality checkpoints

**Important:** Preventive actions should address the root causes you identified in Section 3. Make explicit connections between your root causes and your preventive actions. For example: "PA-003 addresses root cause RC-002 by implementing..."

**Note:** Preventive actions are proactive—they prevent future problems. Use the "Preventive Action" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model.

#### Required Section 6: Conclusions

Write a reflective conclusion (1-2 paragraphs) that:
- Summarizes the key lessons learned from this quality failure
- Reflects on how upstream decisions and processes affect downstream quality
- Discusses the value of systematic quality improvement approaches
- If applicable, notes what the organization actually learned from this experience
- Comments on the relationship between corrective and preventive actions in your case

**Note:** Use the "Conclusions" section in the [example plan](quality-improvement-example.md) as your model.

#### Required Section 7: References

Provide proper citations for all sources used, including:
- News articles, industry reports, or company statements (for real cases)
- Academic or professional resources on quality management
- Industry standards or specifications referenced
- Any frameworks or methodologies cited (ISO 9001, MQM, etc.)

Use a consistent citation style (APA, MLA, or Chicago). Include working URLs where applicable.

### Step 4: Format and polish your document

Before submitting, ensure your plan:
- **Is professionally formatted** with clear headers, appropriate use of tables, and consistent styling
- **Is 3-5 pages** (excluding any cover page and references)
- **Uses inclusive language** that doesn't assume masculine gender as neutral
- **Is free from typos and grammatical errors**
- **Includes proper citations** for all sources

## Reflection Questions

Consider these questions as you develop your plan:

1. How does your root cause analysis reveal that quality issues often originate far from where they become visible?
2. What makes preventive action more valuable than corrective action in the long term, despite being more resource-intensive to implement?
3. How does systematic quality management documentation create organizational learning that extends beyond individual projects?
4. If you examined a real quality failure, what surprised you most about what actually went wrong versus what appeared to go wrong on the surface?
5. How might the principles of quality management you applied here transfer to other industries or contexts?
