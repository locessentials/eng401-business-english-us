# Final Project: Show & Tell Integration

## Welcome

Welcome to the culminating experience of Business English II - your final project that demonstrates comprehensive business English skills through a **"Show & Tell"** approach. This capstone project synthesizes all the knowledge, skills, and specialized vocabulary you've developed throughout the five course units, preparing you for real-world professional communication scenarios.

## Our Topic: The Job Search

You will work in teams to create both a professional business presentation and a comprehensive written report exploring an aspect of **"The Job Search"**—a topic immediately relevant as you prepare to enter the professional world.

Your project will mirror the dual communication formats (spoken and written) frequently required in international business environments while addressing practical challenges you'll face in finding meaningful employment. The predetermined focus on job search strategies ensures your research serves double duty: demonstrating your business English competency while building knowledge you'll apply in your immediate career transition.

## Project Components

The final project consists of four interconnected components that demonstrate different aspects of your business English competency:

### The "Show" Component: Business Presentation
- **Professional presentation slides** (8-10 slides)
- **Recorded presentation delivery** (8-12 minutes)
- Focus on actionable job search strategies and practical recommendations

### The "Tell" Component: Comprehensive Report
- **Written business report** (~1500 words)
- In-depth analysis of job search subtopic with proper citations
- Professional document demonstrating specialized vocabulary

### The Integration Component: Peer Evaluation (Optional but recommended)
- **Peer evaluations** using provided rubrics
- Constructive feedback demonstrating critical analysis skills
- Can invite colleagues, mentors, or professional contacts to evaluate your work
