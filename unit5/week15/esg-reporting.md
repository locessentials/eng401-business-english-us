## Introduction: The Hidden Costs of Our Digital World

Some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today include climate change and social inequality. The technology industry—which powers our phones, computers, and the AI systems we increasingly rely on—provides a stark illustration of how these issues intersect with global business practices.

### The Material Reality Behind Digital Products

While we interact with sleek devices and seamless digital interfaces, the supply chains that make these technologies possible involve significant environmental damage and human exploitation.

#### Cobalt: The "Blood Diamond" of Batteries

Every smartphone, laptop, and electric vehicle battery contains cobalt, and the Democratic Republic of Congo possesses over half of the world's cobalt reserves while producing approximately 74% of global supply. However, this extraction comes at tremendous cost:

**Environmental Impact:**
- Millions of trees have been clear-cut to make way for cobalt mines, creating barren wastelands in areas of once-thriving biodiversity
- Toxic dumping devastates landscapes, pollutes water sources, and contaminates crops with high concentrations of cobalt linked to crop and worm deaths
- Studies found fish from mining-adjacent lakes contaminated with prominent levels of cobalt, spreading to humans through consumption
- The hazy air surrounding mines, full of dust and grit, is toxic to breathe and has been linked to increased risk of birth defects including limb abnormalities and spina bifida

**Human Cost:**
- Artisanal miners work in subhuman, grinding, degrading conditions using pickaxes, shovels, and stretches of rebar to hack at the earth in trenches, pits, and tunnels for the equivalent of just a few dollars a day
- Children are trafficked to work in mines, with entire families forced to bring children into toxic pits to dig just to earn an extra fifty cents or dollar a day that could mean the difference between eating or not
- Tunnel collapses routinely bury workers alive, including children, in conditions lacking supports, ventilation shafts, or rock bolts

#### AI's Hidden Workforce

The artificial intelligence systems marketed as cutting-edge automation actually depend on massive amounts of human labor—labor that remains largely invisible and often exploitative.

**The Reality of "AI" Work:**
- Data labelers are the lifeblood of the AI industry, annotating images, video, and text so AI systems can recognize patterns, yet they are often paid very low wages, work in unsafe environments, and lack basic workplace protections
- Hourly rates for AI data labelers in Venezuela range from 90 cents to $2, compared to $10-25 per hour in the United States
- In the Philippines, workers labeling data for multi-billion dollar companies often earn far below minimum wage, and some labeling providers even resort to child labor
- Many data labelers work in overcrowded and dusty environments which pose serious risks to their health, and they often work as independent contractors lacking access to protections such as health care or compensation

**The Psychological Toll:**
Nearly 100 Kenyan data labelers and AI workers who do work for companies like Facebook, Scale AI, and OpenAI published an open letter to US President Joe Biden stating their working conditions amount to modern day slavery. Content moderators who review violent and disturbing material to train AI systems often develop PTSD, depression, and reduced ability to feel empathy.

## What is ESG Reporting?

Given the profound environmental and social impacts embedded in global business operations, ESG reporting has emerged as a framework for measuring and communicating corporate responsibility.

### The Three Dimensions

ESG is a set of non-financial measures that contribute directly to an organization's risk management profile, sustainability development, and corporate social responsibility:

| Dimension | Key Areas | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Environmental (E)** | Anything that contributes to carbon emissions and climate change, such as energy, water and waste management; ventilation and air quality; materials sourcing; and supply chain management | Carbon footprint reduction, renewable energy adoption, waste management, water conservation, biodiversity protection |
| **Social (S)** | Relationships and reputation a company has with its stakeholders, such as employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, health and safety, human rights, and labor practices | Fair wages, safe working conditions, supply chain labor practices, community impact, diversity initiatives |
| **Governance (G)** | Internal system of practices, controls and procedures that a company uses to govern itself, such as business model resilience, risk management, legal and regulatory compliance, due diligence, and meeting external stakeholders' needs | Board accountability, ethical business practices, transparent reporting, anti-corruption measures |

### Purpose of ESG Reporting

ESG reporting is a type of corporate disclosure that details the environmental, social and governance promises, efforts and progress of an organization, with the purpose of improving investor transparency. These reports shed light on a company's activities regarding climate change, human rights, executive compensation, and other non-financial factors that affect long-term sustainability and risk.

### International Standards

ISO's ESG Implementation Principles (IWA 48) is a high-level structure and set of principles designed to guide organizations in implementing and embedding ESG practices within their organizational culture, supporting management of ESG performance and facilitating measurement and reporting under existing frameworks.

**Key International Frameworks:**
- ISO IWA 48:2024 - ESG Implementation Principles
- IFRS S1 and S2 - Sustainability disclosure standards
- UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

**Why Standardization Matters:**
These principles serve as a universal language for ESG practices, establishing an international reference model that ensures global interoperability and reliability in ESG reporting and practices.

## Common Problems: Performative Responsibility

While ESG reporting should drive genuine change, many companies use it primarily for public relations purposes. Understanding the difference between authentic commitment and performative action is critical.

### Greenwashing

**What is greenwashing?**  
Greenwashing occurs when companies present themselves as environmentally responsible through marketing and public relations while their actual practices tell a different story. The term plays on "whitewashing"—the practice of glossing over or concealing unpleasant facts.

**Common greenwashing tactics:**
- Making vague environmental claims without specific, measurable commitments
- Highlighting minor eco-friendly initiatives while ignoring major environmental harms
- Using green imagery and language in marketing while maintaining harmful practices
- Focusing on one "green" product line while the majority of business remains unsustainable
- Setting distant net-zero targets without concrete interim milestones or plans

**Example in technology:**  
A company might promote its use of recycled materials in device packaging while remaining silent about cobalt mining practices in its battery supply chain, or the e-waste created when devices are designed to be unrepairable and must be replaced frequently.

### Related Forms of Performative Corporate Behavior

**Virtue Signaling**  
Public expressions of opinion intended to demonstrate good character or moral correctness, particularly on social and political issues—often without accompanying substantive action. In corporate contexts, this might involve issuing statements supporting social causes while doing nothing to address similar issues within the company's own operations or supply chain.

**Woke-washing / Social-washing**  
Similar to greenwashing but focused on social justice issues. Companies publicly align themselves with movements for racial justice, gender equality, or LGBTQ+ rights while maintaining discriminatory practices, inequitable pay structures, or exploitative labor conditions.

**Diversity Theater**  
Highly visible diversity initiatives (diverse marketing campaigns, diversity statements, diverse leadership photos) without meaningful changes to hiring practices, workplace culture, advancement opportunities, or pay equity.

### Key Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Greenwashing** | Marketing practices that make products, services, or companies appear more environmentally friendly than they actually are |
| **Virtue Signaling** | Public expression of opinions intended to demonstrate moral correctness without substantive action |
| **Performative** | Actions done primarily for show or appearance rather than genuine commitment |
| **Net Zero** | Achieving balance between greenhouse gases emitted and removed from atmosphere |
| **Carbon Offset** | Compensating for emissions by funding emission reductions elsewhere (often criticized when used instead of actual emission reduction) |
| **Supply Chain Transparency** | Disclosure of where and how products are made, including labor and environmental practices |
| **Scope 1, 2, 3 Emissions** | Categories of carbon emissions (direct, indirect from energy, all other indirect including supply chain) |

## Authentic Responsibility: What Does It Look Like?

Not all ESG reporting is performative. Some organizations genuinely commit to measuring, reporting, and improving their environmental and social impact. Understanding what authentic responsibility looks like helps you evaluate corporate claims critically.

### Signs of Authentic Commitment

**Specific, Measurable Targets with Accountability**
- Clear baseline measurements and year-over-year progress data
- Third-party verification of claims
- Willingness to report setbacks alongside successes
- Concrete interim targets, not just distant future goals

**Supply Chain Transparency**
- Public disclosure of suppliers and manufacturing locations
- Independent audits of labor and environmental practices
- Remediation plans when problems are identified
- Direct engagement with workers and affected communities

**Investment in Systemic Change**
- Significant budget allocation to sustainability initiatives
- Changes to executive compensation tied to ESG metrics
- Industry collaboration to raise standards collectively
- Support for policy changes that affect the entire sector

**Willingness to Sacrifice Short-Term Profits**
- Choosing more expensive but ethical suppliers
- Investing in circular economy models (repair, reuse, recycling)
- Phasing out profitable but harmful products or practices
- Declining business that would require compromising values

### Real-World Examples to Research

**Companies with strong ESG practices (according to various ratings):**
- Patagonia - Activism, supply chain transparency, repair programs
- Interface - Carpet manufacturer pursuing carbon-negative production
- Unilever - Comprehensive sustainable living plan with specific targets
- Microsoft - Carbon negative by 2030 commitment with detailed roadmap

**Important caveat:** Even companies with strong reputations have areas where they fall short. Part of authentic responsibility is acknowledging limitations and working to improve rather than claiming perfection.

### Questions for Evaluation

When reviewing any company's ESG claims, ask:

1. **Are metrics specific and measurable?** Or vague and aspirational?
2. **Is there independent verification?** Or only self-reporting?
3. **Do they report Scope 3 emissions?** (These include supply chain impacts—the hardest to measure but often the largest)
4. **How do they handle setbacks?** With transparency and corrective action, or silence?
5. **Is progress incremental and consistent?** Or do they announce big goals but show little year-over-year change?
6. **Do actions match statements?** Or is there a gap between public commitments and actual practice?

## Activity: ESG Report Analysis

Your task is to find and critically analyze an actual ESG report from a company, placing it on a spectrum from purely performative to authentically responsible.

### Step 1: Select a Company

Choose a company whose ESG report you want to analyze. Consider:

**Technology companies** (given this week's focus on tech supply chains):
- Apple, Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Meta/Facebook, Amazon, Samsung, Dell, HP

**Other major corporations with public ESG reports:**
- Nike, Coca-Cola, Walmart, Nestlé, BP, Shell, Toyota, Volkswagen

**Companies known for sustainability leadership:**
- Patagonia, Interface, Ørsted, Unilever, IKEA

### Step 2: Find and Review the ESG Report

**Where to find reports:**
- Company website (usually under "Investors," "Sustainability," "Corporate Responsibility," or "ESG")
- Search "[Company name] ESG report 2024" or "sustainability report"
- Some companies use different names: "Impact Report," "Citizenship Report," "Corporate Responsibility Report"

**What to look for as you read:**
- Executive summary claims
- Specific data and metrics
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Third-party certifications or audits
- Supply chain disclosures
- Areas where the company acknowledges challenges or failures
- Visual design choices (lots of green imagery? happy worker photos?)

### Step 3: Analyze and Place on Spectrum

**Create a post in the `Innovation` discussion forum that includes:**

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|----------------|
| **Company & Report** | Name, year, link to report, type of company/industry |
| **Initial Impression** | What stood out immediately? Professional design? Specific data? Vague claims? |
| **Strengths** | What did the company do well in their reporting? Specific examples with page numbers |
| **Weaknesses** | What was missing, vague, or unconvincing? Red flags? |
| **Placement on Spectrum** | Where do you place this company?<br>**Purely Performative** ←→ **Authentically Responsible**<br>(Provide a score 1-10 or description of position) |
| **Justification** | Why did you place them there? What specific evidence supports your assessment? |
| **One Recommendation** | What would you advise this company to do to improve their ESG practices or reporting? |

**Length:** 400-600 words total

### Step 4: Compare Analyses

After posting, read your classmates' analyses and consider:

- How do different industries approach ESG reporting?
- Are there common patterns in performative reporting?
- What surprised you about authentic vs. performative practices?
- How might your career in language services intersect with ESG reporting?

## Connection to Your Field

As future professionals in translation, localization, and interpretation, you will likely encounter ESG reporting in your work:

**Translation and localization of ESG reports:**
- Companies publish ESG reports in multiple languages for global stakeholders
- Cultural sensitivity in discussing environmental and social issues varies significantly
- Technical terminology requires specialized knowledge
- Tone and messaging may need adaptation for different markets

**Ethical considerations:**
- Should translators work on reports they believe are greenwashing?
- How do you handle requests to "soften" negative information in translations?
- What responsibility do language professionals have in communicating corporate claims?

**Supply chain awareness:**
- Language service companies have their own ESG responsibilities
- As contractors or employees, you can ask about working conditions and ethical practices
- Understanding ESG helps you evaluate potential employers and clients
