# Understanding Intercultural Competency


## Theory and Research


## Concepts and Terminology

To communicate on the subject of intercultural competency requires understanding the wide range of concepts and terminology that make up this subject field. For this activity, you'll contribute to a shared class glossary on intercultural competency.

To get started, identify a glossary of terminology related to the topic. Once you've found a quality glossary, pick an important term or two from it to add to our class glossary. Add the term, its definition, a citation with a link to resource consulted, and brief comments on why you decided it was important to include the term in our class glossary.

For example: 

| Term | Definition | Citation | Why the Term was Selected | 
| ---- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Intercultural | "What occurs when members of two or more different cultural groups (of whatever size, at whatever level) interact or influence one another in some fashion, whether in person or through various mediated forms." | [UNESCO, Intercultural Competences, 2013](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&id=p::usmarcdef_0000219768&file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_9767a679-bbc0-4f31-a0b4-1ab630073ee0%3F_%3D219768eng.pdf&locale=en&multi=true&ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000219768/PDF/219768eng.pdf#%5B%7B"num"%3A82%2C"gen"%3A0%7D%2C%7B"name"%3A"XYZ"%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D) | We defined culture already on the "Introduction to Teamwork" page. The next logical step in understanding intercultural competency is to define "intercultural". |
| Competence | "Having sufficient skill, ability, knowledge, or training to permit appropriate behavior, whether words or actions, in a particular context." | [UNESCO, Intercultural Competences, 2013](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&id=p::usmarcdef_0000219768&file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_9767a679-bbc0-4f31-a0b4-1ab630073ee0%3F_%3D219768eng.pdf&locale=en&multi=true&ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000219768/PDF/219768eng.pdf#%5B%7B"num"%3A82%2C"gen"%3A0%7D%2C%7B"name"%3A"XYZ"%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D) | To understand intercultural competency, we need to know what a competency is. |
| Intercultural competence | "Having adequate relevant knowledge about particular cultures, as well as general knowledge about the sorts of issues arising when members of different cultures interact, holding receptive attitutes that encourage establishing and maintaining contact with diverse others, as well as having the skills required to draw upon both knowledge and attitudes when interacting with others from different cultures." | [UNESCO, Intercultural Competences, 2013](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/in/documentViewer.xhtml?v=2.1.196&id=p::usmarcdef_0000219768&file=/in/rest/annotationSVC/DownloadWatermarkedAttachment/attach_import_9767a679-bbc0-4f31-a0b4-1ab630073ee0%3F_%3D219768eng.pdf&locale=en&multi=true&ark=/ark:/48223/pf0000219768/PDF/219768eng.pdf#%5B%7B"num"%3A82%2C"gen"%3A0%7D%2C%7B"name"%3A"XYZ"%7D%2Cnull%2Cnull%2C0%5D) | Intuitively, intercultural competency is the ability to work with people from different cultures. This definition makes what that ability entails tangible. |

## Advancing Your Intercultural Competency

The e-book [Advancing Intercultural Competence for Global Learners](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/interculturalcompetence) addresses key areas in which we can develop our intercultural competency skills: listening, observing, critical thinking, evaluating, building relationhips, developing empathy and so on.

Pick one of these areas, review the contents associated with that skill, and then reflect upon what you can do to improve your intercultural competence in that area. Some prompts have been provided to help direct your thinking about that area.
