# A Comparison of Specifications

In this set of activities we'll dive a little bit deeper into the topic of specifications, focusing on the structure, terminology, linguistic conventions followed in this text type. We'll start by studying an example of standards-based translation specifications, and then you'll find an example set of specifications for a specific industry besides translation.

## Translation Specifications

The next page presents the example of [Tranquality's Standards-Based Structured Translation Specifications](https://www.tranquality.info/specs). This set of specifications was developed based on an important standard in the language services industry: [ASTM F2575: Standard Practice for Language Translation](https://store.astm.org/f2575-23e02.html).

In the activities that follow, you'll explore each of the resources more deeply.

### Part 1: Meet the Text

Go to the next page, and review 

**Questions for Consideration**

- Why are specifications needed? That is, what are the goals of writing specifications?
- The section presents the types of requirements that should be defined in translation and localization specficiations. Based on that discussion, what generalizations can you make about the types of requirements that should be defined in specifications (no matter the industry)? Why?
- Once established, how are specifications used?

## Specifications: Topics Covered and Technical Precision

The chapter you just read outlines the importance of specifications in the translation and localization domain, but technical specifications are used in many other industries. Technical specifications are also a type of international standard. ASTM International is a U.S. based standardization body in which technical specifications are produced by technical committees in a wide variety of industries, and the rules for writing these standards are very specific. The activities that follow will help you understand the technical nature of specifications, and the precision that is needed when writing them.

### Activity 1 - Topics Covered by Technical Specifications

What topics do specifications cover? To answer that question, we can find some examples of technical specifications written by a standards body like ASTM International. We'll get an idea of the breadth of coverage of specifications through a class poll.

**Poll Everywhere:** [pollev.com/alainabrandt831](pollev.com/alainabrandt831)

1. Navigate to the [ASTM International website](https://www.astm.org) and do a search of the word "specifications".
2. Find an example of a set of specifications that covers a topic that interests you.
3. Respond to the survey on Poll Everywhere, answering these questions:
  - What specific specifications document did you explore?
  - What does the specification cover?
  - What do you notice about the specialized terminology and/or linguistic conventions used in the discussion of the specifications?
  
Please be sure to include your name in your response on Poll Everywhere.
  
### Activity 2 - Technical Precision

ASTM International's publication "[Form and Style for ASTM Standards](https://store.astm.org/media/pdf/bluebook_FormStyle.pdf)" (AKA the "Blue Book") presents the rules that must be followed when writing international standards. We'll explore this resource via another poll to understand some of the rules that must be followed when writing specifications for ASTM International.

1. Review part B of the document: "Form of ASTM Specifications"
2. Pick a section that you find to be important to keep in mind when writing specifications.
3. Respond to the survey on Poll Everywhere, answering these questions:
  - What section did you concentrate on?
  - What does that section cover?
  - What did you learn from reviewing that section?

## Connections and Reflection

### Connecting What We've Covered to This Week's Activities

Your assignment for this week is to write a set of specifications for the production of a product or service. You won't need to meet the precision required for an international standard, but still the topics covered here are crucial for understanding the text type of specifications.

### Reflect on What You've Learned

As you work through the materials on specifications, reflect on these questions:

- How can specifications benefit you in your everyday work?
- In the domain of translation and localization, how would you contribute to specifications in various production roles?
- What strategies can you follow to establish effective specifications in your work?
