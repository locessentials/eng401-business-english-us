# How to Use these Course Contents


## 🤖 Using Course Materials with GAI Tools

All course content is written in [**Markdown format**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for easy integration with AI learning tools. Content written in markdown format can be better "understood" by generative AI tools, as the hierarchy and emphasis of content is clearly communicated through symbols. You can learn more about the philosophy behind the Markdown design here: [How to Use these Course Contents](how-to-use.md).

To download any lesson as a markdown file for use with GAI tools:

1. **Visit our course repository**: [github.com/alainamb/uic_tr-35-business-english-II](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II)
2. **Navigate to any lesson file** (files ending in `.md`)
3. **Click the file name** to open it
4. **Click the three dots** in the top right
5. **Click download**
6. **Double-click on the downloaded file** to open it in a text editor.

### 📓 GAI Study Tip
