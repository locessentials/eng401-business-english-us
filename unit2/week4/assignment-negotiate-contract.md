## Overview
The Herod clause in the Loc101 NDA (the intellectual property transfer) is not the only unfair term in that agreement.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Apply contract analysis skills to identify unfair or problematic clauses
- Use professional language to propose alternative contract terms
- Demonstrate understanding of power dynamics in contract negotiations
- Practice using MS Word's collaborative editing tools for professional document review

## Required Preparation

### Step 1: Study Professional NDA Standards

**Read:** ["9 Clauses to Include in Every NDA" by Axial](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/Axial_9-Clauses-to-Include-in-Every-NDA.pdf)

This document outlines essential concepts for understanding NDAs, including:
- **One-way vs. mutual agreements:** Who benefits from different structures
- **Broad vs. narrow definitions:** How language scope affects each party
- **Inevitable vs. compelled disclosure:** Different types of information sharing
- **Standard negotiation practices:** What professional deal-makers expect

### Step 2: Enhance Your Negotiation Skills (Optional)

**Additional Resource:** [Negotiation Skills Report by Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/Negotiation_Skills_Free_Report.pdf)

Key insights for contract discussions:
- Preparing for difficult questions or pushback
- Managing professional relationships during negotiations
- Balancing assertiveness with collaboration
- Understanding when and how to escalate concerns

## Assignment Instructions

### Phase 1: Document Analysis

**Download the editable Loc101 NDA** from the Teams assignment.

**Using MS Word's commenting feature:**
- Identify negotiation tactics used in the agreement (broad definitions, one-sided terms, etc.)
- Flag clauses that primarily benefit the Disclosing Party
- Note any language that seems unclear, excessive, or unreasonable
- Reference concepts from the Axial article to support your analysis

**Comment examples**
- *"This clause gives the disclosing party perpetual rights without any reciprocal obligations."*
- *"The destruction requirement for learning materials is unusual - students typically retain educational materials they've paid for."*
- *"This severability clause primarily protects the disclosing party's interests if parts of the agreement are found unenforceable."*

### Phase 2: Contract Revision

**Using MS Word's track changes feature:**
- Rewrite problematic clauses to be more mutually beneficial
- Strike terms that are completely unreasonable
- Add missing protections for the receiving party
- Ensure your language maintains a formal, professional tone

**Track Changes Best Practices**
- **Deletions:** Strike problematic language completely when necessary
- **Additions:** Add protective language for receiving party
- **Modifications:** Revise one-sided terms to be more balanced
- **Comments:** Explain your reasoning and reference supporting evidence

**Revision principles**
- Make terms more balanced between both parties
- Add reasonable time limits to open-ended obligations
- Include protections for the receiving party's rights
- Clarify vague or ambiguous language

**Example revision**
- **Original:** *"Receiving Party hereby grants to Disclosing Party full, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide..."*
- **Revised:** *"Any intellectual property created by Receiving Party remains the property of Receiving Party. Disclosing Party may reference learning outcomes from the seminar in general terms without attribution."*

**Language Expectations**
- Use formal business register appropriate for legal documents
- Employ precise legal vocabulary when possible
- Maintain respectful tone even when challenging unfair terms
- Write clearly and concisely

### Phase 3: File Submission

**File format:** MS Word (.docx) with track changes and comments visible

**Save your negotiated version as:**
`LastNames1_LastNames2_NDA-negotiation.docx`

**Examples**
- `Brandt_MartínezWilliams_NDA-negotiation.docx`
- `MartínezWilliams_Chen_Brandt_NDA-negotiation.docx`
- `Chen_NDA-negotiation.docx`

**Answer Key:** If you read "7 Clauses to Include in Every NDA", you should be able to find the areas you should have negotiated easily. You can also reach out to the instructor for an answer key.
