## Assignment Overview

For this assignment, you will conduct a complete counter-negotiation of the Loc101 NDA to demonstrate your understanding of contract anatomy and your ability to identify problematic terms.

## Required Preparation

### Step 1: Study Professional NDA Standards

**Read:** ["9 Clauses to Include in Every NDA" by Axial](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/Axial_9-Clauses-to-Include-in-Every-NDA.pdf)

This document outlines essential concepts for understanding NDAs, including:
- **One-way vs. mutual agreements:** Who benefits from different structures
- **Broad vs. narrow definitions:** How language scope affects each party
- **Inevitable vs. compelled disclosure:** Different types of information sharing
- **Standard negotiation practices:** What professional deal-makers expect

### Step 2: Enhance Your Negotiation Skills (Optional)

**Additional Resource:** [Negotiation Skills Report by Harvard Law School Program on Negotiation](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/Negotiation_Skills_Free_Report.pdf)

Key insights for contract discussions:
- Preparing for difficult questions or pushback
- Managing professional relationships during negotiations
- Balancing assertiveness with collaboration
- Understanding when and how to escalate concerns

## Assignment Instructions

### Phase 1: Document Analysis

**Download the editable Loc101 NDA** from the Teams assignment.

**Using MS Word's commenting feature:**
- Identify negotiation tactics used in the agreement (broad definitions, one-sided terms, etc.)
- Flag clauses that primarily benefit the Disclosing Party
- Note any language that seems unclear, excessive, or unreasonable
- Reference concepts from the Axial article to support your analysis

**Comment examples**
- *"This clause gives the disclosing party perpetual rights without any reciprocal obligations."*
- *"The destruction requirement for learning materials is unusual - students typically retain educational materials they've paid for."*
- *"This severability clause primarily protects the disclosing party's interests if parts of the agreement are found unenforceable."*

### Phase 2: Contract Revision

**Using MS Word's track changes feature:**
- Rewrite problematic clauses to be more mutually beneficial
- Strike terms that are completely unreasonable
- Add missing protections for the receiving party
- Ensure your language maintains a formal, professional tone

**Track Changes Best Practices**
- **Deletions:** Strike problematic language completely when necessary
- **Additions:** Add protective language for receiving party
- **Modifications:** Revise one-sided terms to be more balanced
- **Comments:** Explain your reasoning and reference supporting evidence

**Revision principles**
- Make terms more balanced between both parties
- Add reasonable time limits to open-ended obligations
- Include protections for the receiving party's rights
- Clarify vague or ambiguous language

**Example revision**
- **Original:** *"Receiving Party hereby grants to Disclosing Party full, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide..."*
- **Revised:** *"Any intellectual property created by Receiving Party remains the property of Receiving Party. Disclosing Party may reference learning outcomes from the seminar in general terms without attribution."*

**Language Expectations**
- Use formal business register appropriate for legal documents
- Employ precise legal vocabulary when possible
- Maintain respectful tone even when challenging unfair terms
- Write clearly and concisely

### Phase 3: File Preparation

**Save your negotiated version as:**
`GroupMembersFirstLastNames_NDA-negotiation.docx`

**Examples**
- `Reyes-Brandt_NDA-negotiation.docx`
- `Martinez-Chen-Williams_NDA-negotiation.docx`
- `Rodriguez-Kim_NDA-negotiation.docx`
