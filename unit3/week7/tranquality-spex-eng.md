# Tranquality's Standards-Based Structured Translation Specifications

## Translation Parameters

The following list of parameters is adapted from [ASTM F2575: Standard Practice for Language Translation](https://store.astm.org/f2575-23e02.html). It contains 21 parameters that describe various aspects of translation projects.

## A. Linguistic work product parameters [1–13]

### A.1. Source-content information [1–5] 
*(much of this can be inferred by examining the source content)*

#### 1. **Textual characteristics**
   1. **Source language** (including locale information, such as UK vs. American English)
   2. **Text type** (class to which a text is assigned based on its function, format, or the specific intention of the author with respect to the target audience, e.g. annual report)
   3. **Audience**
   4. **Purpose** (*Skopos* in Functionalist translation theory)

#### 2. **Specialized language**
   1. **Subject field**
   2. **Terminology** (terms marked in the source text [e.g. ITS], without target-language equivalents)

#### 3. **Volume** 
(i.e., size or length in words, characters, or some other unit)

#### 4. **Complexity** 
(e.g., written by a non-native of the source language? Text embedded in graphics?)

#### 5. **Origin** 
(e.g., the source text is itself a translation)

### A.2. Target content requirements [6–13]

#### 6. **Target language requirements**
   1. **Target language** (including locale, e.g. Canadian French)
   2. **Target terminology** (project-specific bilingual terminology)

#### 7. **Audience** 
(especially as it differs from intended audience of the source content)

#### 8. **Purpose** 
(especially when it differs from the purpose of the source content)

#### 9. **Content correspondence** 
(assumes a degree of **accuracy** appropriate to type of content correspondence: full segment-by-segment translation vs. summary; overt vs. covert [localization, transcreation, etc.]; MT-HT spectrum; etc.)

#### 10. **Register** 
(from formal to familiar; tone used in addressing audience)

#### 11. **Format** 
(file and modality [file: Word, InDesign, etc.]; [modality: document, subtitles, etc.])

#### 12. **Style** 
(within the baseline of a level of **fluency** appropriate to audience and purpose)
   1. **Style guide** (e.g. Chicago Manual of Style or a company guide)
   2. **Style relevance** (is a high degree of readability important in this case?)

#### 13. **Layout** 
(margins, headings, etc.)

## B. Process Tasks [14—15]

#### 14. **Typical tasks** 
(note: if post-editing is involved, it falls in 14b, not 14c)
   1. **Preparation**
   2. **Initial translation** (MAHT using tools, HAMT post-editing, or raw machine translation)
   3. **In-process quality assurance** (revision [bilingual], review [monolingual], proofreading)

#### 15. **Additional tasks** 
(e.g. third party review, terminology check, software testing, or back translation)

## C. Project Environment [16–18]; Relationships [19–21]

#### 16. **Technology** 
(is any particular technology to be used in the project?)

#### 17. **Reference materials** 
(translation memories, termbases to supplement that in 6b, etc.)

#### 18. **Workplace requirements** 
(e.g. security measures, safety concerns)

#### 19. **Permissions**
   1. **Copyright** (who holds copyright for target text, translation memory, etc.?)
   2. **Recognition** (does the translator’s name appear in the published translation?)
   3. **Restrictions** (on the use of materials, such as translation memory, after the project, etc.)

#### 20. **Submissions**
   1. **Qualifications** (expected or required qualifications of provider)
   2. **Deliverables** (the target content in the specified format, updated termbase, etc.)
   3. **Delivery method** (email, sFTP, etc.)
   4. **Delivery deadline(s)**

#### 21. **Expectations**
   1. **Compensation** (typically costs)
   2. **Communication** (channels and mode among stakeholders)

**Notes:** In 1, 7 and 8: The audience and the purpose can be plural in some cases. Tasks defined in 14c (revision, review, proofreading) that can follow initial translation were taken from ISO 17100.
