## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Find Your Company's Financial Statements

1. Go to the SEC CIK Lookup: [https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/cik-lookup](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings/cik-lookup)

2. Search for your company name

4. Find the most recent **10-Q** (quarterly report)

   ![10-K and 10-Q Reports Section](images/10-K-and-10-Q-Reports.png)
   
5. Open the 10-Q and locate:
   - Consolidated Balance Sheets
   - Consolidated Statements of Income (or Operations)

### Step 2: Extract Financial Data

**For Balance Sheet - find these items:**
- Current Assets
- Total Assets  
- Current Liabilities
- Total Liabilities
- Total Equity

**For Income Statement - find these items:**
- Total Revenue (or Net Sales)
- Gross Profit
- Operating Income  
- Net Income

**Create simple tables like this:**

| Balance Sheet Item | Current Period | Previous Period | Change |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Current Assets | $X,XXX | $X,XXX | +X% |
| Total Assets | $X,XXX | $X,XXX | +X% |
| Current Liabilities | $X,XXX | $X,XXX | +X% |

### Step 3: Do Basic Calculations

**Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities**
- Above 1.0 = company can pay short-term debts
- Compare both time periods

**Net Profit Margin = Net Income ÷ Total Revenue × 100**
- Shows what percentage of sales becomes profit
- Compare both time periods

### Step 4: Research Context

Look up recent news articles or analyst reports about your company to understand:
- How experts view the company's performance
- Any major business developments affecting financial results
- Industry trends that might explain the numbers you found

### Step 5: Write Your Report

Follow the instructions on report structure above to write a report containing these sections:
- Introduction
- Balance Sheet Summary
- Income Statement Summary
- Synthesis of Your Analysis
- Conclusion
- Works Consulted
