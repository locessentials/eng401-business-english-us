# Business Technology Quick Start Guide Assignment

**Worth:** 3 points

**Format:** Individual or group work

## Assignment Overview

In modern workplaces, professionals constantly encounter new technologies—cloud platforms, collaboration tools, project management systems, communication software. The ability to quickly learn and teach others how to use these technologies is an essential professional skill.

Your task is to create a **Quick Start Guide** that helps someone with no prior experience begin using a specific business technology tool efficiently and confidently. Your guide should get users up and running quickly, focusing on essential functions rather than comprehensive coverage.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Apply plain language principles to create accessible technical documentation
- Evaluate business technology tools from a user perspective
- Develop professional documentation skills essential for workplace communication
- Practice explaining technical concepts to non-technical audiences
- Create reusable resources that help others adopt new technologies efficiently

---

## Why Quick Start Guides matter

Unlike comprehensive user manuals that document every feature, Quick Start Guides serve a specific purpose: getting new users productive quickly. In business environments:

- **Time is limited**: Employees need to learn new tools while continuing their regular work
- **Adoption is critical**: Well-designed onboarding reduces resistance to new technologies
- **Confidence matters**: Clear, accessible documentation reduces anxiety about using new tools
- **Efficiency is valued**: Users want to accomplish specific tasks, not master every feature
- **Questions arise predictably**: Most new users encounter the same challenges

Your Quick Start Guide demonstrates your ability to bridge technical complexity and user needs—a skill highly valued in translation, localization, and all forms of business communication.

## Plain Language in User Documentation

When creating documentation for users, a key objective is presenting content following plain language principles established in [ISO 24495-1:2023](https://www.iso.org/standard/78906.html). These principles ensure that information is genuinely useful for users.

### The Four Principles of Plain Language

The fundamental principles are:

| Principle | What It Means | In Practice |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Relevant** | Readers get what they need | • Focus on tasks users actually want to accomplish<br>• Exclude unnecessary technical details<br>• Address common questions and scenarios<br>• Prioritize essential information over comprehensive coverage |
| **Findable** | Readers can easily locate what they need | • Use clear, descriptive headings and subheadings<br>• Organize content logically (often sequentially for Quick Start Guides)<br>• Include a table of contents for longer documents<br>• Use consistent formatting to create visual hierarchy |
| **Understandable** | Readers can easily comprehend what they find | • Use simple, direct language<br>• Define technical terms when first introduced<br>• Write short sentences and paragraphs<br>• Use active voice ("Click Submit" not "Submit should be clicked")<br>• Include examples and screenshots to illustrate concepts |
| **Usable** | Readers can easily apply the information | • Provide step-by-step instructions<br>• Number sequential steps clearly<br>• Include screenshots showing exactly what users will see<br>• Anticipate and address common problems<br>• Test instructions by having someone unfamiliar with the tool follow them |

### Additional Considerations for Technical Documentation

Beyond the four core principles, effective Quick Start Guides also demonstrate:

- **Accessibility**: Language that doesn't assume advanced technical knowledge
- **Empathy**: Understanding user frustrations and anxieties about new technology
- **Accuracy**: Information that matches what users actually see and experience
- **Currency**: Up-to-date content reflecting current versions of software
- **Cultural awareness**: Inclusive language and examples that work across contexts

**Throughout this assignment, you'll be evaluated on how well you apply these plain language principles to create documentation that genuinely helps users.**

## Part 1: Technology Selection

When selecting a technology for your Quick Start Guide, you have free reign to choose any tool used in business environments. You're encouraged to pick either a technology you know well and use regularly, or one you'd like to learn for professional purposes. You'll also want to pick a tool with good existing documentation you can reference (without directly copying) and avoid overly complex enterprise software that would be difficult to document clearly.

Appropriate business technologies include collaboration and communication tools (Slack, Zoom), project management platforms (Trello, Asana), productivity and organization software (Notion, Google Workspace), desktop publishing tools (Canva), cloud storage services, CRM systems, or any other technology commonly used in professional settings.

**Translation technology is prohibited** because you've studied those tools in your other classes and this assignment focuses on general business applications.

### Getting Your Choice Approved

Before you begin your guide, contact the instructor directly about your technology choice. Include which 3-4 tasks you plan to cover. Wait for approval confirming no other team has claimed this technology and the tasks you've decided to cover are appropriate.

## Part 2: Your Quick Start Guide

After you've selected your technology and gotten instructor approval, start using the tool yourself, noting where you get confused (these become your troubleshooting tips). Create your guide following the six required sections below, include 4-6 screenshots, and submit your work in MS Word and PDF format.

> Some goals of Help Desk documentation include not over-investing in training material development while also not scaling inefficiency due to a lack of information. That said, the documentation you develop can and should be iterated on over time. Small teams may benefit more from lighter guides and simultaneous chat communication. Larger teams will need much greater levels of documentation to standardize work. The flow of documentation also needs to correspond with product development.
>
> Here, you'll find two versions of the same work instruction that illustrate iterative development and serve as examples of the documentation that you're required to write for this assignment. What differences do you note between the two?

> 
> **Version 2:** [Time Tracking with TopTracker](https://admin.locessentials.com/time-tracking-with-toptracker) (Blog post)
>
> **Note:** These work instructions do not correspond to your assignment instructions exactly, so please be sure to read the instructions thoroughly instead of just replicating the structure of these guides.
>
> **Flashback:** Remember that one of the principles of [Agile Project Management](https://agilemanifesto.org) is: working software over comprehensive documentation. If it speaks to you, let that principle guide your work!

Your Quick Start Guide must include the following components.

### Required Section 1: Introduction and Overview

**What to include:**
- **Tool name and purpose** (1-2 sentences): What is this technology and what is it used for?
- **Primary audience** (1 sentence): Who typically uses this tool? (e.g., "project managers," "remote teams," "anyone tracking personal finances")
- **Key benefits** (2-4 bullet points): Why would someone use this instead of alternatives?
- **What this guide covers** (1-2 sentences): What will users be able to do after following this guide?

**Length:** Approximately half a page

### Required Section 2: Getting Started

**What to include:**
- **System requirements** (if applicable): What devices, browsers, or accounts are needed?
- **Account creation/access steps**: How does someone get access to this tool?
- **Initial setup**: Any necessary configuration before using the tool?

**Requirements:**
- Clear, numbered steps for any sequential processes
- At least **1-2 screenshots** showing key setup screens
- Links to relevant pages (signup page, download page, help documentation)
- Expected to take users 5-15 minutes to complete

**Length:** Approximately 1 page

**Example structure:**
```
1. Create an account here: [link]
2. Verify your email address
3. Download the desktop application here: [link] (if applicable)
4. Sign in using your credentials
```

### Required Section 3: Core Features and Basic Tasks

**What to include:**
- **3-5 essential tasks** that new users need to accomplish
- Step-by-step instructions for each task
- **At least 3-4 screenshots** illustrating key actions or screens
- Tips for successful use

**Selecting essential tasks:**
Focus on what users need to do first and most frequently, not advanced features. For example:
- For a project management tool: Create a project, add a task, assign a task, mark a task complete
- For a communication platform: Join a channel, send a message, share a file, schedule a meeting
- For a cloud storage service: Upload a file, share a file with specific people, organize files in folders, recover a deleted file

**Requirements:**
- Use action-oriented headings ("How to Create a New Project" not "Project Creation")
- Number sequential steps clearly
- Include callouts or annotations on screenshots when helpful
- Anticipate where users might get confused and provide extra guidance

**Length:** Approximately 2-3 pages

### Required Section 4: Key Terminology

**What to include:**

## Part 3: Helpful Tips for your Drafting Workflow

### Tip 1: Research the technology thoroughly

Before writing, spend time using the tool:
- Create an account and complete the basic setup yourself
- Try to accomplish common tasks
- Note where you got confused or stuck (these become your troubleshooting section)
- Review the official documentation to understand terminology
- Watch tutorial videos to see how others explain the tool
- Check reviews to understand what users commonly struggle with

**Research goal:** You should be comfortable using the basic features before you start writing about them.

### Tip 2: Outline your guide

Plan your structure:
- List the 3-5 essential tasks you'll cover
- Decide what terminology needs definition
- Identify where screenshots will be most helpful
- Plan the logical flow of information

**Collaboration tip:** If working in a team, divide tasks now:
- One person focuses on account setup and getting started
- Another person documents specific features
- Someone else handles screenshots and visual design
- Another person writes troubleshooting and gathers resources

### Tip 3: Apply plain language principles

Review your draft against the four plain language principles:

| Principle | Checks |
| --------- | ------- |
| **Is it Relevant?** | - Have you focused on what users actually need to know?<br>- Did you exclude unnecessary technical details?<br>- Are you addressing the most common use cases? |
| **Is it Findable?** | - Do your headings clearly indicate what each section covers?<br>- Is the organization logical and sequential?<br>- Can someone scan the document and find specific information quickly? |
| **Is it Understandable?** | - Have you used simple, direct language?<br>- Are technical terms defined when first introduced?<br>- Would someone unfamiliar with the tool be able to follow your instructions? |
| **Is it Usable?** | - Can someone actually accomplish the tasks by following your steps?<br>- Have you included enough detail without overwhelming users?<br>- Do your screenshots show exactly what users will see? |
