Hello, my name is Alaina Brandt, and I designed these course contents. I am a Spanish<>English translator, and I've taught translation and localization to hundreds of students in universities in the United States, China and Mexico. I have a master's degree in language, literature and translation, along with professional certificates from MIT in generative artificial intelligence, data science and machine learning, and web programming. I've served in the executive leadership of such professional associations as the American Translators Association and technical committee F43 on language services and products of ASTM International.

Are you interested in collaborating on multilingual technology and NLP? I would live to connect with researchers and professionals who work at the intersection of language and technology.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/alainambrandt/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alainambrandt/)

Here's wishing you a great deal of success as you work through this course!

## Acknowledgements

The TR35 Business English course was first commissioned to be taught in the undergraduate Translation, Localization and Interpreting program at the Universidad Intercontinental in Mexico City. The course was built with the help of Claude Sonnet 4-4.5, and the course outline was established based on syllabi for previous versions of the course taught by other professors.
