# Introduction to Quality Management Systems (QMS)

Quality means different things to different people. To illustrate that, let's start this lesson with a poll. Head over to Poll Everywhere and respond to the discussion question.

To make the subjective idea of quality objective, we can start by having discussions about goals and needs, define requirements in specifications, produce work in keeping with specifications, and then measure our outcomes against specifications. If what we produced does not correspond to our specifications, or if the work corresponds to inaccurate specifications, we don't have quality work. In this context, quality management systems (QMS) are about refining specification setting and production methods so that workflows have good quality outcomes. Here good quality outcomes are consistent and the meet -or surpass- stakeholder needs.

## From Translation Quality to Quality Management Systems

The following section examines quality management principles through the specific lens of translation and localization work. While the examples focus on translation quality—a topic directly relevant to your future careers—the underlying concepts apply across industries and business contexts. As you read, pay attention to how quality management works in translation workflows, but also consider how these same principles might function in manufacturing, software development, healthcare, or any other field where systematic quality control matters.

The goal is twofold: to understand quality standards in your chosen profession and to recognize the universal principles that make quality management systems effective in any context.
> This chapter began with a discussion about the fact that every role – no matter the industry or level – entails project management. While the assessment of translation quality often focuses upon the work performed by the translator, translators are just one part of larger production processes, and mishandling the product at any stage compromises the quality of that product. If production is underquoted, for example, that has a downstream impact on quality. That said, all stages in localization workflows are a part of quality management. Then again, certain steps within localization workflows are quality management proper, such as the editing and proofreading steps in a standard TEP workflow, and any in-context reviews that take place as translated content is imported into the localized product environment.

> In the ISO 9000 family of standards on quality management systems (QMS), quality is defined as the “degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object fulfills requirements” (ISO 9000 QMS - Fundamentals and vocabulary, Section 3.6.2). An overall QMS consists of many parts, and quality management is the combination of quality planning, quality control and quality audits (among other activities), which when combined can produce continual quality improvement. These activities embody the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles recommended in ISO 9001 - QMS Requirements (Section 0.3.1), in which production is planned, production is carried out according to the plan, the product that is the result of production is checked against the plan and any opportunities or gaps within the plan and how the plan was carried out are acted upon as the cycle begins again. Overall, quality managers should be thought of as process managers’ best source of information about whether production as configured is producing intended results.

### Making Connections: From Translation Quality to QMS

Consider the following questions after reading about translation quality management:

1. **Universal Principles:** The passage describes quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object fulfills requirements." How might this definition apply to products or services outside of translation? Choose an industry different from translation and explain how this definition would work in that context.
2. **Upstream Effects:** The text notes that "if production is underquoted, that has a downstream impact on quality." What does this tell us about how different stages in any production process affect final quality? Can you think of examples from other industries where problems early in the process compromise the final product?
3. **The Human Factor:** Translation quality depends on multiple roles beyond just the translator (project managers, editors, proofreaders, technical specialists). Why do you think quality management systems emphasize the entire process rather than focusing only on the people who create the core product? How might this process-oriented approach change how we think about responsibility for quality?
4. **Plan-Do-Check-Act in Practice:** The ISO 9001 standard recommends continuous Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles. Looking at the translation workflow described (planning, translation, editing, proofreading, in-context review), how do you see these cycles working? Where else might this cyclical approach to quality improvement be valuable?
5. **Your Future Role:** As future translation, localization, and interpretation professionals, how does understanding systematic quality management influence how you think about your work? What responsibilities for quality might you have beyond producing accurate translations?
