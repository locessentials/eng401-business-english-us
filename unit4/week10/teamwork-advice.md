# Advice for Working in Teams from a U.S. Perspective

The topic of teamwork is vast and can be covered from so many angles. The topic of interculturally competent teamwork cannot be approached without an understanding of culture, or the elements of language, educational and experiential backgrounds, age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and nationality, religious and non-religious beliefs, political ideologies, and customs of groups of people. Interculturally competent teamwork is relevant to both international business environments, in which time zones, different levels of language ability in a common language, and different communication expectations need to be navigated. Interculturally competent teamwork is also relevant in businesses that operate in a single country with a diverse workforce, as is increasingly becoming the case as the world becomes more interconnected.

**Note:** Within this topic you're asked to share about your individual preferences about teamwork, along with your perceptions around the expectations about teamwork within a culture to which you belong. Please be respectful when discussing culturally-tied expectations around teamwork and the stereotypes associated with those expectations. Please also be aware that when sharing specific examples, these may be shocking and cause harm in repeating any discriminatory statements you’ve heard. Please keep the intersectionality comprising each of our identities in mind when discussing culture.

## Warmup Activities: Our Perceptions of and Preferences for Teamwork

As a warmup for our activities on the topic of interculturally competent teamwork, please reflect upon your perceptions of and experiences working in teams - in professional, educational, and/or personal settings. Here are some discussion prompts to get you thinking about your experiences.

### Do's and Don't's of Teamwork

- Share one **positive experience** you've had working in a team. Describe the team, its size, the setting, the most-used communication mode (in-person? online?) and frequency of communication, and the project the team was tasked with. What characteristics of the team do you feel made it an enjoyable experience? What did the team accomplish together that you are most proud of?
- Share one **negative experience** you've had working in a team. Describe the team, its size, the setting, the most-used communication mode (in-person? online?) and frequency of communication, and the project the team was tasked with. What characteristics of the team do you feel made it a negative experience? Were there things that the team was unable to accomplish? If yes, what were they and why do you think the team was unable to meet their goals?

As you narrate your experiences, we'll generalize your experiences into the personalized guidelines we have for working in a team by listing the do's and don't's we took away from the stories of your experiences.
