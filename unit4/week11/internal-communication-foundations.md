# Foundations of Internal Communication

## Introduction

Internal communication is a vital component of organizational success. Whether updating employees on policies, preparing for challenges, ensuring organizational safety, or listening to employee feedback, effective internal communication is integral to effective management. This page explores foundational concepts in internal communication, with particular attention to the **three primary directions of organizational communication**:

- **Downward communication**: Messages flowing from management to employees
- **Upward communication**: Methods for employees to express concerns and feedback to management  
- **Lateral communication**: Peer-to-peer communication among employees, and strategies to prevent misinformation

To be successful, organizations need comprehensive policies and strategies for communicating with their internal stakeholders—their employees at all levels.

## Key Literature

### 1. Managing Organizational Communication (SHRM, 2021)

#### Summary

The Society for Human Resource Management's toolkit on organizational communication provides a comprehensive framework for understanding communication as a management function. The document emphasizes that **effective communication is not simply about delivering messages—it's about building relationships, fostering trust, and enabling organizational success**.

**Key insights on communication directions:**

**Downward Communication** (Management to Employees):
- Most communication strategies are "top-down, with senior management setting the tone for a cascading series of messages"
- Effective downward communication requires consistency to establish a strong employment brand
- Leadership must align messages with the organization's mission, vision, and culture
- Communication vehicles include town hall meetings, newsletters, emails, and face-to-face meetings

**Upward Communication** (Employees to Management):
- Two-way communication plays an essential role in comprehensive communication strategy
- "Listening to employee issues and concerns builds loyalty and drives improved productivity"
- Organizations can discover potential issues before they become formal grievances or lawsuits
- Methods include surveys, focus groups, suggestion systems, and open-door policies
- **Critical caveat**: "There is no better way to cause resentment among employees than to ask them for feedback and then fail to act in response to their concerns"

**Lateral Communication** (Employee to Employee):
- The document addresses the "grapevine"—informal employee-to-employee communication
- "Watercooler discussions are still a mechanism for employees to hear the latest news unfiltered by management"
- The grapevine "should not be discounted when considering the best tool to listen to and learn about employee issues"
- Social media policies are necessary as "employees using this medium to communicate among themselves"

**Impact of Communication Quality:**
- **Effective communication**: Builds morale, satisfaction, and engagement; reduces misunderstandings and potential legal issues; improves processes and efficiency
- **Ineffective communication**: Increases chances for misunderstandings; damages relationships; breaks trust; increases anger and hostility

#### Critical Analysis Questions

1. The SHRM document notes that asking for employee feedback and then failing to act creates resentment. In your experience (or in organizations you've observed), what are the consequences when organizations create channels for upward communication but don't respond meaningfully? How might this affect future communication attempts?

2. The toolkit acknowledges that "the grapevine" exists in all organizations and suggests it should not be discounted. How should organizations balance formal downward communication with the reality of informal lateral communication networks? Can the grapevine be an asset rather than a liability?

3. The document emphasizes that communication should be linked to business strategy. However, it's often difficult to measure the ROI of communication. If you were tasked with demonstrating the value of improved internal communication to skeptical executives, what metrics or approaches would you use?

### 2. Examining the Effects of Internal Communication and Emotional Culture (Men, Yue, & Ferguson, 2020)

#### Summary

This study investigates how **symmetrical internal communication** and **leaders' use of motivating language** contribute to creating a positive emotional culture, which in turn enhances employees' organizational identification. The research is particularly significant because it examines the emerging role of emotional culture—the affective aspect of organizational life that governs which emotions people express and experience at work.

**Key findings on communication directions:**

**Symmetrical Communication** (Bidirectional):
- Symmetrical communication is characterized by "openness, reciprocity, negotiation, and tolerance for disagreement between organizations and employees"
- This communication model empowers employees in decision-making to reach mutually agreed solutions
- Symmetrical communication positively predicts positive emotional culture (culture of joy, companionate love, pride, and gratitude)
- The relationship between communication and employee outcomes is **fully mediated** by emotional culture

**Leadership Communication** (Downward with Dialogue):
- Leaders' motivating language includes three components:
  - **Meaning-making language**: Connecting employees' goals with organizational purpose
  - **Empathetic language**: Expressing support, compassion, and respect
  - **Direction-giving language**: Clarifying expectations and providing feedback
- Motivating language had a stronger effect on emotional culture (β = .60) than symmetrical communication (β = .25)
- Leadership communication does not directly affect organizational identification—it works through emotional culture

**The Role of Emotional Culture:**
- Emotional culture features joy, companionate love, pride, and gratitude
- It fully mediates the relationship between communication and organizational identification
- "It is essentially how employees *feel* about the organization that produces the degree of identification"

#### Critical Analysis Questions

1. The study found that emotional culture **fully mediated** the relationship between communication and organizational identification—meaning communication doesn't directly create identification, but rather creates emotional culture, which then creates identification. What are the practical implications of this finding? Should communicators focus more on creating emotional experiences than on delivering information?

2. The research shows that leaders' motivating language had more than twice the effect on emotional culture compared to organizational symmetrical communication systems. Why might one-on-one leadership communication be more powerful than organization-wide communication? What does this suggest about where organizations should invest resources?

3. The study focuses on *positive* emotional culture (joy, love, pride, gratitude). However, all organizations also experience negative emotions (frustration, anxiety, disappointment). How should organizations address or communicate about negative emotions? Should these be suppressed, acknowledged, or processed differently?

### 3. Rethinking Internal Communication: A Stakeholder Approach (Welch & Jackson, 2007)

#### Summary

Welch and Jackson's influential article argues that internal communication has been inadequately theorized and proposes a **multidimensional stakeholder approach** to address gaps in the literature. They introduce the **Internal Communication Matrix**, which distinguishes between different **dimensions** and **levels** of internal communication.

**The Internal Communication Matrix identifies four dimensions:**

1. **Internal line management communication**: Communication between supervisors and employees about roles, performance, and task-related matters (primarily **downward** with some **upward** feedback)

2. **Internal team peer communication**: Communication among team members about team tasks and goals (primarily **lateral**)

3. **Internal project peer communication**: Communication among project team members across different departments (primarily **lateral**)

4. **Internal corporate communication**: Communication between senior management and all employees about organizational strategy, goals, and changes (primarily **downward** with mechanisms for **upward** feedback)

**Key theoretical contributions:**

- **Previous approaches treated employees as a "single public"**—this matrix differentiates between different stakeholder groups and communication needs
- **Direction matters**: The matrix explicitly identifies whether communication is predominantly one-way or two-way, and in which direction
- **Content differs**: Each dimension involves different types of information (role expectations vs. team coordination vs. organizational strategy)
- **Strategic vs. operational**: Internal corporate communication focuses on strategy; line management focuses on day-to-day operations

**On preventing misinformation:**
- The article emphasizes the importance of **symmetrical communication** at all levels
- Tolerance for disagreement and negotiation helps surface concerns before they become rumors
- **Consistent messaging** across all four dimensions prevents mixed signals
- Leaders at all levels must be "coached on their role in ensuring effective companywide communication"

#### Critical Analysis Questions

1. The Internal Communication Matrix suggests that organizations should think about internal communication across four different dimensions (line management, team peer, project peer, and corporate). In your experience, do organizations actually manage these dimensions separately, or do they blend together? What problems might arise if an organization focuses only on "internal corporate communication" and neglects the other dimensions?

2. Welch and Jackson criticize the tendency to treat employees as a "single public." However, creating different messages for different internal stakeholder groups could lead to perceptions of unfairness or "secret" information. How can organizations balance targeted communication with transparency and equity?

3. The article was published in 2007—before the widespread adoption of social media, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and other collaboration platforms. How have these technologies changed the four dimensions of internal communication? Do the categories still make sense, or do we need new frameworks?

## Reflection Questions

Consider these questions as you think about the readings and your own experiences:

1. **Communication direction and power**: All three readings acknowledge that organizations typically favor downward communication over upward or lateral communication. Why do you think this is? What organizational or human factors make it difficult to create truly bidirectional communication?

2. **The gap between intention and practice**: The SHRM toolkit notes that failing to act on employee feedback creates resentment. The Welch & Jackson article emphasizes symmetry and dialogue. Yet many organizations continue to struggle with two-way communication. What are the barriers—cultural, structural, or personal—that prevent organizations from implementing what research says works?

3. **Emotional culture in your context**: Men, Yue, and Ferguson emphasize that emotional culture mediates the relationship between communication and identification. Thinking about an organization you know well (your workplace, your university, a student organization), what is the emotional culture? What emotions are encouraged, discouraged, or ignored? How does communication create or reinforce this culture?

4. **Lateral communication and the grapevine**: How do you think the rise of workplace messaging platforms (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp groups) has changed lateral communication? Has it made the "grapevine" more powerful, more visible, or easier to influence?

5. **Translation and localization perspective**: As future translation and localization professionals, you'll often be involved in adapting internal communications for different cultural contexts. How might the three communication directions (downward, upward, lateral) be perceived differently in different cultural contexts? For example, might upward communication be more or less welcomed in different organizational cultures?
