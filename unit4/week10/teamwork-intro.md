# Introduction to Teamwork

The topic of teamwork is vast and can be covered from so many angles. The topic of interculturally competent teamwork cannot be approached without an understanding of culture, or the elements of language, educational and experiential backgrounds, age, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, and nationality, religious and non-religious beliefs, political ideologies, and customs of groups of people. Interculturally competent teamwork is relevant to both international business environments, in which time zones, different levels of language ability in a common language, and different communication expectations need to be navigated. Interculturally competent teamwork is also relevant in businesses that operate in a single country with a diverse workforce, as is increasingly becoming the case as the world becomes more interconnected.

**Note:** Within this topic you're asked to share about your individual preferences about teamwork, along with your perceptions around the expectations about teamwork within a culture to which you belong. Please be respectful when discussing culturally-tied expectations around teamwork and the stereotypes associated with those expectations. Please also be aware that when sharing specific examples, these may be shocking and cause harm in repeating any discriminatory statements you’ve heard. Please keep the intersectionality comprising each of our identities in mind when discussing culture.

## Warmup Activities: Our Perceptions of and Preferences for Teamwork

As a warmup for our activities on the topic of interculturally competent teamwork, please reflect upon your perceptions of and experiences working in teams - in professional, educational, and/or personal settings. Here are some discussion prompts to get you thinking about your experiences.

### Do's and Don't's of Teamwork

- Share one **positive experience** you've had working in a team. Describe the team, its size, the setting, the most-used communication mode (in-person? online?) and frequency of communication, and the project the team was tasked with. What characteristics of the team do you feel made it an enjoyable experience? What did the team accomplish together that you are most proud of?
- Share one **negative experience** you've had working in a team. Describe the team, its size, the setting, the most-used communication mode (in-person? online?) and frequency of communication, and the project the team was tasked with. What characteristics of the team do you feel made it a negative experience? Were there things that the team was unable to accomplish? If yes, what were they and why do you think the team was unable to meet their goals?

As you narrate your experiences, we'll generalize your experiences into the personalized guidelines we have for working in a team by listing the do's and don't's we took away from the stories of your experiences.

**Do's and Don't's of Teamwork**

| Narrator | Contributor | Do's |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Alaina | Alaina | Have clearly defined roles for each team member |

| Narrator | Contributor | Don't's |
| -------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Alaina | Alaina | Don’t try to motivate people by comparing their performance to their peer’s performance. |

### Culturally-Tied Expectations about Teamwork

Next, we'll discuss culturally-tied expectations about Teamwork. Here, please contribute your perseptive about an expectation for teamwork from a culture to which you belong or are familiar with. Let us know the culture the expectations comes from. Describe the perceived expectation itself. Then give some advice for navigating the expectation.

| Contributor | Culture | Perceived Expectation | Navigating the Expectation |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Alaina | White European American | A leader is the person who speaks the most. | To be promoted within White European American spaces, introverts will need to learn to speak up a lot. |

## Teamwork from a U.S. Perspective

Now, let's explore some resources that should help you navigate teamwork in diverse international teams. Please note that the recommendations here are based upon an American (from the United States) perspective.

### Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter

Start the lesson by watching the video "Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter," in which Katherine Phillips, Reuben Mark Professor of Organizational Character at Colombia Business School, shares advice about working in diverse and international teams. A transcript of this talk has been included below.

#### Knowledge Check: Diverse Teams Are Smarter

After watching the video, check your understanding by taking this quiz.

**1) According to Katherine Phillips, what is groupthink? Select the correct answer.**
  - Type of bias in which people are less likely to question the possible different perspectives when in an environment in which everyone has the same surface-level identity characteristics (race, gender)
  - Type of consensus that is easily reached when people share the same surface-level identity characteristics (race, gender)

**2) According to Katherine Phillips, what happens to a person who works in a group in which most people share the same surface-level identity characteristics (race, gender) when the person has unique information? Select all that apply.**
  - The person is less likely to bring up the idea confidently, if they bring the idea up at all.
  - The group is more likely to be dismissive of the idea.
  - The environment feels more hostile to the person than a diverse one.

**3) According to Katherine Phillips, what are the benefits of working in a team in which diverse surface-level identity characteristics (race, gender) are represented? Select all that apply.**
  - Legitimization of the presence of different perspectives
  - Enhanced pre-meeting preparation, information sharing, and complex problem solving
  - Greater creativity
  - Greater effort
  - Teams that are diverse according to surface-level identity characteristics (race, gender) work harder.

**4) According to Katherine Phillips, what practical strategies can we adopt to mitigate bias when working in diverse teams? Select all that apply.**
  - Focus on problem solving, rather than debating opinions.
  - Make sure that everyone is given approximately equal airtime. Don’t let some groups dominate the discussion over others.
  - Have those who have the surface-level identity characteristics of people who are typically lower status in social hierarchies speak first.
  - Adopt a no-interruption rule.
  - Adopt a unanimous rule policy for decision making, since homogenous majorities have no incentive to listen to group minorities under a majority rule system.

## Self Reflection on Teamwork

Now that you've worked through the first activities on teamwork for this week, do some self reflection...

- Much of the advice presented here is based on a U.S. perspective. Do you find the advice to be applicable to your context?
- In "My Advice on Teamwork," you learn that one of the instructor's mottos is: If everyone at the table is a dog playing poker, be a dog playing poker. What does that motto mean? What motto(s) would you adopt for teamwork?
