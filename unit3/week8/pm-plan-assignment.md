# Project Management Plan Assignment

**Worth:** 3 points

**Format:** Individual or group work

## Overview

Throughout this week, you have explored production workflows, project management methodologies, and the essential documentation tools that project managers use to organize work and facilitate team communication. You've examined how different methodologies like Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, and Lean shape project execution, and you've studied practical tools like Gantt charts, risk registers, and query trackers.

Now you'll apply this knowledge by stepping into the project manager's role and creating a comprehensive project management plan for a business project of your choice. This assignment simulates the critical work project managers do when launching new initiatives: establishing clear communication protocols, identifying team members and their responsibilities, planning realistic timelines, anticipating potential obstacles, and setting up systems for tracking questions and decisions.

Your plan will serve as a communication document that helps your team understand how the project will be executed, who is responsible for what, and how to navigate challenges as they arise.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Develop comprehensive project management documentation that establishes clear communication protocols for diverse teams
- Apply project management concepts including workflow sequencing, risk mitigation, and query management to realistic business scenarios
- Create professional documentation that balances detail with scan-ability for busy stakeholders
- Demonstrate understanding of the project manager's role in facilitating team coordination and success

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Form your team and select a project scenario

You may work individually or in teams. Working in a team allows you to simulate the collaborative nature of real project management and share the workload.

**Select a business project** for which you'll develop your project management plan. Consider these guidelines:

- **Draw from experience**: If you have experience in a particular industry or with specific types of projects, leverage that knowledge to create a more realistic and detailed plan
- **Explore new interests**: Alternatively, use this as an opportunity to explore a project type you're curious about but haven't managed before
- **Make it realistic**: Choose a project with clear deliverables, multiple team members, and a defined timeline (ideally 4-10 weeks in duration)
- **Consider your field**: Translation and localization students might choose projects like website localization, software translation, or multimedia content adaptation, but you're welcome to explore projects in marketing, product development, event planning, or any other business context

**Project examples:**
- Launching a new product or service
- Organizing a major event or conference
- Developing a marketing campaign
- Creating educational content or training materials
- Implementing a new business process or system
- Producing a multimedia project (video series, podcast, digital publication)

### Step 2: Research and plan your project management approach

Before creating your plan, research how projects like yours are typically managed:

- What project management methodology would work best for your project type? (Consider Waterfall, Agile, Kanban, or hybrid approaches)
- What roles and expertise are typically needed for this type of project?
- What are common risks or challenges that arise?
- What is a realistic timeline for completing the work?

You may want to review the [PM Plan Example](pm-plan-example.md) to see how project management documentation is structured and what level of detail is appropriate.

### Step 3: Create your Project Management Plan

Your plan must include the following sections:

#### Required Section 1: Project Title and Description
- Give your project a clear, professional title
- Write a concise description (2-4 sentences) that explains what the project aims to accomplish
- Include the project manager's name (you or your team lead)

#### Required Section 2: People Involved
Create a contact list with **at least 5 different roles** on your project team. For each person include:
- Name (can be fictional, but use realistic names from diverse cultural backgrounds)
- Role/title
- What team members should contact this person about
- Contact information (email is sufficient)

**Note:** This section helps establish clear communication channels so team members know who to reach out to for specific needs.

#### Required Section 3: Gantt Chart
Create a project timeline showing **at least 5 different tasks or phases**. Your Gantt chart should:
- Show the sequencing of tasks over time (use weeks or similar time periods)
- Include both finish-to-start and start-to-start sequencing where appropriate
- Use visual elements (bars, blocks, or shading) to represent work periods
- Identify any key milestones or deliverables
- Include a legend explaining your visual notation

**Tip:** Use a table format as shown in the [PM Plan Example](pm-plan-example.md) for easy creation in Word.

#### Required Section 4: Risk Register
Document **at least 3 potential risks** to your project. For each risk include:
- Risk ID (e.g., R-001, R-002)
- Clear description of what could go wrong
- Probability (Low/Medium/High)
- Impact if the risk occurs (Low/Medium/High)
- Risk owner (who will monitor this risk)
- Mitigation strategy (how you'll prevent or minimize the risk)
- Current status (Active/Mitigated/Monitored)

**Important:** After your risk register table, include a note instructing team members how to add newly identified risks and who to notify.

#### Required Section 5: Queries Tracker
Document **at least 3 queries or questions** that might arise during your project. For each query include:
- Query ID (e.g., Q-001, Q-002)
- Date raised
- Who raised the query
- Category or topic
- The question itself
- Response/resolution
- Who responded
- Date resolved
- Status (Open/Closed/Pending)

**Important:** After your queries table, include a note instructing team members how to add new queries and who to notify.

#### Required Section 6: Project Management Platform
Describe what technology platform or tools your team will use to manage the project. Consider:
- What platform will you use for day-to-day project tracking? (e.g., GitHub Projects, Trello, Asana, Notion, Google Workspace, Microsoft Teams, etc.)
- What specific features or boards will you use within that platform?
- How will team members access and update their work?
- What expectations do you have for how often team members should update their status?

### Step 4: Format and polish your document

Before submitting, ensure your plan:
- **Is professionally formatted** with clear headers, appropriate use of tables, and consistent styling
- **Is 2-3 pages** (excluding any cover page)
- **Uses inclusive language** that doesn't assume masculine gender as neutral (use "they/them," job titles instead of gendered terms, and diverse names for team members)
- **Is free from typos and grammatical errors**
- **Follows proper file naming conventions**

### Step 5: Submit your Project Management Plan

**File format:** One MS Word document in .docx format

**File naming conventions:** 
- For individual submissions: `LastNames_pm-plan.docx`
- For team submissions: `LastNames1_LastNames2_pm-plan.docx` (list all team members' last names separated by underscores)
- For example: 
  - `MartínezWilliams_Chen_Brandt_EthicsCaseStudy.docx`
  - `Chen_EthicsCaseStudy.docx`

Make sure your Word document includes all required sections and meets the specifications outlined above.

**Due date:** End of week

## Reflection Questions

Consider these questions as you develop your plan:

1. How does creating this documentation upfront help prevent problems during project execution?
2. What communication challenges might arise in your chosen project type, and how does your plan address them?
3. How might your project management approach need to adapt if the project scope changes or unexpected obstacles arise?
4. What makes your project management plan user-friendly for team members who might be new to the project?
