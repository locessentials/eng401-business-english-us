# Team Charter Assignment

**Worth:** 3 points

**Format:** Individual or group work

## Overview

Throughout this week, you have explored the complexities of interculturally competent teamwork. You've analyzed how diverse perspectives strengthen team problem-solving while also creating potential for misunderstanding. You've examined how cultural dimensions like power distance, individualism versus collectivism, and communication styles shape team dynamics. 

Now you'll apply this knowledge by creating a team charter—a foundational document that establishes how your team will work together effectively. This assignment simulates the critical work that successful teams do before diving into production: explicitly defining expectations about communication, decision-making, roles, and conflict resolution to prevent misunderstandings and build trust from the start.

Your team charter will serve as a living document that guides your collaboration, helping you navigate differences constructively and leverage each team member's unique strengths.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Develop comprehensive team agreements that establish clear expectations for collaboration
- Apply intercultural communication principles to create inclusive team processes
- Design communication and decision-making protocols that honor diverse working styles and preferences
- Demonstrate understanding of how explicit agreements prevent conflicts and support team success
- Create professional team documentation that can be adapted for future collaborative projects

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Form your team and select a project

**Team formation:** You may work individually or in a group. While working individually allows you to design your ideal team charter, working with actual teammates provides valuable practice in the negotiation and compromise that real team charter development requires.

**Select a project:** Identify what project your team has come together to deliver. This could be:
- A project you're currently working on
- Your final "Show & Tell" presentation and report project
- A hypothetical professional project relevant to your field (translation/localization project, marketing campaign, event planning, content development, etc.)
- Any collaborative endeavor where clear team agreements would improve outcomes

**Important:** The project you select should be substantial enough to require meaningful collaboration over several weeks. If you're using a hypothetical scenario, make it realistic and detailed enough to inform concrete team charter decisions.

### Step 2: Review the team charter template and identify areas for improvement

**Download the template:** Access the Team Charter template provided in the [References](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/tree/main/unit4/week10/references) section. This template covers essential sections including:
- Team Charter Statement (your team's commitment to one another)
- Objectives (what you aim to accomplish and learn)
- Values (principles guiding your work)
- Decision Making (governance processes)
- Roles (general and individual responsibilities)
- Communication (platforms, availability, response times)
- Meetings (structure and expectations)
- Conflict Resolution (strategies for handling disagreements)
- Feedback (how you'll share and receive constructive input)
- Work Methods (workload distribution and delivery processes)

**Critically evaluate the template:** As you review it, consider:
- What sections or prompts are missing that would be valuable for your team?
- Are there aspects of intercultural communication that should be addressed more explicitly?
- How might you restructure sections for better clarity or usability?
- What additional prompts would help your team have important conversations?

### Step 3: Customize and fill out your team charter

**If working individually:**
- Review the template and identify areas you believe it misses
- Add new sections or prompts that address gaps (for example: technology preferences, cultural considerations, learning goals, accessibility needs)
- Revise existing sections to improve clarity or depth
- Fill out the charter as if you were establishing agreements with a real team, making your responses specific and realistic rather than generic
- In your responses, demonstrate awareness of how different team members might have different preferences and needs

**If working as a team:**
- Schedule a team meeting (video call or in-person) to discuss and complete the charter together
- As you work through each section, share your individual preferences and needs openly
- Identify areas where the template could be improved or expanded for your specific context
- Add new sections or prompts that would strengthen your team's ability to work together
- Negotiate agreements that honor everyone's working styles, schedules, and communication preferences
- Make your commitments concrete and specific rather than vague (for example, specify exact response timeframes, particular platforms, specific meeting times)

#### Critical considerations for your charter

*Communication and cultural awareness:*
- Acknowledge different time zones, schedules, and availability constraints
- Consider language preferences and communication styles
- Address accessibility needs (captioning preferences, document formats, meeting accommodations)
- Respect different cultural norms around directness, hierarchy, and feedback

*Realistic and specific commitments:*
- Use concrete timeframes rather than vague terms ("within 24 hours on weekdays" rather than "promptly")
- Specify actual platforms and tools you'll use
- Create a realistic schedule of availability that accounts for everyone's other obligations
- Establish clear escalation paths for when someone cannot meet a commitment

*Flexibility and learning:*
- Acknowledge that this is a living document that may need revision as you learn about working together
- Include a process for revising the charter if needed
- Frame the charter as a learning opportunity rather than a rigid contract

### Step 4: Format and polish your team charter

Before submitting, ensure your charter:
- **Is professionally formatted** with clear headers, appropriate use of tables where helpful, and consistent styling
- **Is complete** with all template sections filled out thoughtfully (not with placeholder text)
- **Includes any additions or improvements** you made to the original template
- **Uses inclusive language** that doesn't assume masculine gender as neutral
- **Is free from typos and grammatical errors**
- **Reflects your team's unique context** rather than generic statements
- **Demonstrates intercultural awareness** in how agreements are structured

### Step 5: Submit your team charter

**File naming conventions**
- For individual submissions: `LastNames_team-charter.docx`
- For team submissions: `LastNames1_LastNames2_team-charter.docx`

**What to submit:**
- Your completed and customized team charter as a Word document
- Ensure all sections are filled out with specific, meaningful content
- Include any new sections or substantial revisions you made to improve the template

**Please deliver your document in MS Word format so that it can be easily commented on and edited using track changes.**

## Reflection Questions

Consider these questions as you develop your charter:

1. How does making implicit expectations explicit prevent misunderstandings and conflicts in team settings?
2. What aspects of intercultural communication are most relevant for your team's specific context?
3. How can team charters balance structure with the flexibility needed to accommodate different working styles?
4. If working with a team: What compromises did you need to make, and how did you negotiate different preferences?
5. How might the agreements you've established in this charter apply to other collaborative contexts in your academic or professional life?
6. What surprised you most about what needed to be discussed when establishing team agreements?
