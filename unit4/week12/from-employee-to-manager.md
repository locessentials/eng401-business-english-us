# From Employee to Manager

Organizations sometimes like to promote from within rather go through a hiring process to fill roles that have opened. When they promote, it makes sense that they would promote a key performer within a team. A key performer who consistently meets or exceeds expectations may excel within production roles, but management requires a completely new set of skills. To keep key performers performing in management roles, training and development is necessary. This training and development is a piece that organizations sometimes miss. People get promotions for being good at their jobs and then are not taught how to be managers.

Not developing people into managers has profound impact on team performance. Within a U.S. context, it is often said that: 

> People don't jobs - they quit managers.

This page collects tips that can help new managers develop their people leading skills, so they can avoid becoming a manager that people want to quit.

## Active Learning for Up-and-coming Managers

This page covers the shift from employee to manager, one-on-one's and formal performance management documentation. These are three practical areas that new managers will need to navigate almost if not immediately. The page presents ten articles related to these topics. Pick one, read the article, and then share your takeaways about the article with the class.

You can do so in a Teams post or by volunteering information during our class discussion. Your comments could address any of these areas:

- Points within the article that you agree or disagree with, and why
- Recommendations that you would implement as a new manager
- The skills you believe new managers should develop first
- Synthesis of ideas from multiple articles
- Gaps within the materials presented

Please also feel encouraged to do your own research on this topic and to share any resources you find to be particularly compelling.

## The Transition to Management

As stated above, even if you are very good at your job, you may not have the skills to be an excellent manager right from the start. Management ability comes from experience and training and development. Key recommendations for new managers from the articles featured in this section are to:

- Listen and learn before making big changes
- Focus more on the big picture
- Make changes incrementally
- Learn to delegate
- Find ways to help your direct reports grow

## Employee-Manager One-on-One's

This statement may seem obvious, but as a manager it's your job to manage your employees. Frequently planned opportunities for deeper conversation will help you to keep issues surfaced in a timely manner, thereby making sure that issues will be more addressable. Problems that are left festering too long can become uncontrollable and require greater infrastructure and resources to address than many small issues that are attending to on an ongoing basis.

A one-on-one, also known as a 1:1 meeting, is a a meeting that managers typically have once a week with each of their employees. One-on-one's are not just an opportunity to surface issues. One-on-one's also allow managers to get to their employees' career goals, which helps managers to effectively develop their team's skills.

The articles featured in this section cover topics related to fostering the communication that happens within one-on-one meetings.
