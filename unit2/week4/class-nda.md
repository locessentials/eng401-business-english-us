# Class NDA Analysis

**Time Investment:** 45-60 minutes of analysis and reflection

## The Central Question

**Before we begin: Would you sign this NDA?**

Below you'll find a non-disclosure agreement used for educational purposes in a professional localization seminar. As you read through it, consider whether you would agree to its terms.

---

## The Loc101 Non-Disclosure Agreement

**THIS AGREEMENT** is made at the time of delivery of the Loc101 Introduction to Localization seminar

**BY AND BETWEEN**

1. Alaina Brandt, Loc101 Instructor and Facilitator and Founder of Localization Essentials ("LocEssentials"), and any guest speakers in LocEssentials seminars (referred to as the "Disclosing Party" or the "Disclosing Parties"); and
2. Participants enrolled in any rendition of the Loc101 Introduction to Localization seminar by Alaina Brandt of LocEssentials (the "Receiving Party" and participants collectively referred to as the "Receiving Parties")

Collectively referred to as the "Parties".

**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS**

This agreement is based on the acknowledgement of the primary objective of the activities known broadly as language services and specifically as localization management and/or translation management: the production of target language products in languages that may be foreign and undecipherable to many project stakeholders, including but not limited to project managers, account managers, desktop publishers, localization engineers, terminology managers, vendor managers, quality managers, and production managers. This agreement further acknowledges that the integrity of that foreign language product is the result of the decision-making and collaboration that takes place between mother-language translators and linguists who can read the product and managers, engineers, and designers working with content that may be undecipherable to them.

This agreement is issued in the spirit of fostering the explicit and candid communication necessary to achieve the high levels of learning and development that may prepare Receiving Parties to assume the responsibilities of the localization manager overseeing this kind of content development in high-risk environments and circumstances.

**DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**

For the purposes of this seminar, confidential information does not include any content that is publicly available, including but not limited to agreements, books, articles, essays, blogs, podcasts, videocasts, videos, presentations, and interviews.

For the purposes of this seminar, confidential information includes any scenarios and/or content presented that could cause damages to Disclosing Parties and their partners, including but not limited to former and existing clients, employers, and colleagues, if that information became publicly available. Confidential information may include verbal discussions, "off-the-record" conversations, live and recorded interviews with guest speakers, password-protected presentations and recordings, standards, written notes, analyses, processes, methods, techniques, development plans, projects, research data, personal information, knowledge of clients, employers, and colleagues, and product files in various formats, whether sanitized of client-identifying information or not, and any content produced with the use of such information.

**SCOPE OF CONFIDENTIAL OBLIGATION BY THE RECEIVING PARTY**

Receiving Parties acknowledge that this seminar gives them special access to confidential information that would not otherwise be available to them. Receiving Parties affirm that they will not share this confidential information with any other parties besides those with whom they are taking this seminar without first obtaining express documented permission from the owner of such content.

Disclosing Parties will make a good faith effort to identify confidential information during the seminar, though Receiving Parties are expected to use reasonable judgment to identify confidential information. Confidential information may be identified verbally, in writing, through password protection, with labels, or through other explicit means.

Receiving Parties will make every effort to safeguard the integrity of information that has been identified as confidential, by excluding any and all confidential information they encounter in this seminar from the content they share. Receiving Parties may use confidential information to achieve learning objectives within the confines of the seminar.

Receiving Party also agrees to destroy any confidential information shared by their, her, or his colleagues and any Disclosing Parties upon the conclusion of the Loc101 Introduction to Localization seminar.

**EXCLUSIONS FROM CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT**

Neither Disclosing nor Receiving Parties can be held responsible for the data security of content shared online through the content storage transfer providers employed by LocEssentials to deliver the seminar, including but not limited to Gmail, cloud CAT technology, Google networks, or through any learning management systems.

Receiving Parties use any links to third-party websites and applications at their own risk. Receiving Parties should review the terms and conditions of any third-party websites and applications they interact with through this seminar as they deem necessary and appropriate.

**TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT**

Receiving Party is kindly asked to maintain the integrity of any confidential information they encounter in this seminar for a time period without limitation.

If any of the terms outlined in this Agreement are determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that shall not affect the enforceability of the rest of this Agreement.

Receiving Party hereby grants to Disclosing Party full, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, display, distribute, adapt, modify, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any way, any and all intellectual property contributed by Receiving Party to the Loc101 Introduction to Localization seminar, and any intellectual property produced by Receiving Party as a learning outcome of the Loc101 Introduction to Localization seminar now and at any point in the future, including after termination of the Loc101 Introduction to Localization Seminar.

**For and on behalf of the Disclosing Party:**
