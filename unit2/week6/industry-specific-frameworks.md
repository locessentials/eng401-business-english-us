# Industry-Specific Regulatory Frameworks Activity

## Learning Objectives

Now that we understand the overarching trade framework between Mexico and the United States, we'll examine how regulations work for specific industries. This activity will help you develop research skills for finding regulatory information and build vocabulary essential for working with cross-border businesses.

## Background: Using Trade Data to Guide Our Research

We've selected the industries for this activity based in part on [Observatory of Economic Complexity data on Mexico and U.S. trade](https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-country/mex/partner/usa?selector538id=HS4&selector539id=tradeOption). This data shows us the most significant trade categories between our countries, making our research directly relevant to real business relationships.

By focusing on industries with substantial bilateral trade volume, we're studying regulations that actually impact thousands of businesses and millions of workers across both countries.

## Your Research Task

Working in small groups, you'll research regulatory frameworks for specific industries. Your goal is to identify what regulations apply to businesses in these sectors and understand the key provisions that companies must navigate.

### Research Process
