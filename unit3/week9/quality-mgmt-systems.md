# Introduction to Quality Management Systems (QMS)

Quality means different things to different people. To illustrate that, let's start this lesson with a poll. Head over to Poll Everywhere and respond to the discussion question.

To make the subjective idea of quality objective, we can start by having discussions about goals and needs, define requirements in specifications, produce work in keeping with specifications, and then measure our outcomes against specifications. If what we produced does not correspond to our specifications, or if the work corresponds to inaccurate specifications, we don't have quality work. In this context, quality management systems (QMS) are about refining specification setting and production methods so that workflows have good quality outcomes. Here good quality outcomes are consistent and the meet -or surpass- stakeholder needs.

## From Translation Quality to Quality Management Systems

The following section examines quality management principles through the specific lens of translation and localization work. While the examples focus on translation quality—a topic directly relevant to your future careers—the underlying concepts apply across industries and business contexts. As you read, pay attention to how quality management works in translation workflows, but also consider how these same principles might function in manufacturing, software development, healthcare, or any other field where systematic quality control matters.

The goal is twofold: to understand quality standards in your chosen profession and to recognize the universal principles that make quality management systems effective in any context.
> This chapter began with a discussion about the fact that every role – no matter the industry or level – entails project management. While the assessment of translation quality often focuses upon the work performed by the translator, translators are just one part of larger production processes, and mishandling the product at any stage compromises the quality of that product. If production is underquoted, for example, that has a downstream impact on quality. That said, all stages in localization workflows are a part of quality management. Then again, certain steps within localization workflows are quality management proper, such as the editing and proofreading steps in a standard TEP workflow, and any in-context reviews that take place as translated content is imported into the localized product environment.

> In the ISO 9000 family of standards on quality management systems (QMS), quality is defined as the “degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object fulfills requirements” (ISO 9000 QMS - Fundamentals and vocabulary, Section 3.6.2). An overall QMS consists of many parts, and quality management is the combination of quality planning, quality control and quality audits (among other activities), which when combined can produce continual quality improvement. These activities embody the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles recommended in ISO 9001 - QMS Requirements (Section 0.3.1), in which production is planned, production is carried out according to the plan, the product that is the result of production is checked against the plan and any opportunities or gaps within the plan and how the plan was carried out are acted upon as the cycle begins again. Overall, quality managers should be thought of as process managers’ best source of information about whether production as configured is producing intended results.

### Making Connections: From Translation Quality to QMS

Consider the following questions after reading about translation quality management:

1. **Universal Principles:** The passage describes quality as "the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of an object fulfills requirements." How might this definition apply to products or services outside of translation? Choose an industry different from translation and explain how this definition would work in that context.
2. **Upstream Effects:** The text notes that "if production is underquoted, that has a downstream impact on quality." What does this tell us about how different stages in any production process affect final quality? Can you think of examples from other industries where problems early in the process compromise the final product?
3. **The Human Factor:** Translation quality depends on multiple roles beyond just the translator (project managers, editors, proofreaders, technical specialists). Why do you think quality management systems emphasize the entire process rather than focusing only on the people who create the core product? How might this process-oriented approach change how we think about responsibility for quality?
4. **Plan-Do-Check-Act in Practice:** The ISO 9001 standard recommends continuous Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles. Looking at the translation workflow described (planning, translation, editing, proofreading, in-context review), how do you see these cycles working? Where else might this cyclical approach to quality improvement be valuable?
5. **Your Future Role:** As future translation, localization, and interpretation professionals, how does understanding systematic quality management influence how you think about your work? What responsibilities for quality might you have beyond producing accurate translations?

## Correcting Quality One Non-Conforming Output at a Time

![A yellow broken robot on the ground](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/main/unit3/week9/images/broken-robot.png)

A non-conforming output, or a non-conforming product, is one that does not meet requirements, given the specifications and the developmental step at which point any non-conformities are identified. Non-conformities are essentially errors in the product, but not every product with errors is considered non-conforming. For example, in production workflows, we expect that a translation will be delivered with some errors. That is why editing is planned after translation so those errors can be rectified. A non-conforming product is therefore one that surpasses the error threshold for the given step.

### Identifying Non-Conforming Outputs

Non-conforming outputs can be identified in a number of ways: by establishing what are the acceptable margins of error, and through error counts and time based metrics. In manufacturing environments, tolerance limits (the upper and lower boundaries of acceptable variation) are often established, and a workflow is considered successful if it only produces non-conforming product a very small percentage of the time. For machine learning tasks, often 95% accuracy is often considered to be a good achievement point where any gains in accuracy are not worth the computational costs. In translation and localization, often error counts and time based metrics are used as indicators of quality.

Within the error counting methodology based on systems such as [Multidimensional Quality Metrics](https://themqm.org), errors are identified, categorized and counted, with critical errors being those that could cause physical injury, reputational damage, etc. Here, limits on the number of errors in each category that will be considered acceptable are tied to timelines and costs, where rush projects paid at low rates obviously realistically are likely to have more errors.

| Level | Number |
| ----- | ------ |
| Critical | Number |
| Major | Number |
| Minor | Number |
| Neutral | Number |

Time-based metrics are another way of determining if a product has surpassed the acceptable error threshold. Metrics are equations in which a unit of measure is multiplied by the time needed to process that unit. Metrics are used to determine how long a step should take, given the volume. The establishment of metrics requires [time studies on processes](https://www.isixsigma.com/business-process-management-bpm/preparing-measure-process-work-time-study), and an explicit definition of the level of quality to be produced.

| Step | Metric |
| ----- | ------ |
| Translation | 300 words/hour |
| Editing & Proofreading | 1500 words/hour |
| In-Context Review | 15000 words/hour |
| Final Review | 45000 words/hour |

Let’s say we have a metric of 1500 words per hour for the editing stage. Under this metric a project of 750 words should take a half hour to edit, and a project of 3000 words should take 2 hours to edit. If an editor needs more time than the time allotted by the metric to complete the editing stage, the product is identified as non-conforming product, assuming that the editor is proficient at editing.

Following the examples given here, if an editor needs 1 hour to edit a project of 750 words, that equals a loss of one half hour. If an editor needs 4 hours to edit a project of 3000 words, the equals a loss of 2 hours. In both cases, the time beyond the amount of time allotted by the metric is the time lost.

### Recuperating Financially from Non-Conforming Outputs

Measuring non-conforming products according to time is a simple way to tie a monetary value to time losses. If our organization’s hourly rate is $75 USD, we can next calculate our monetary losses as $35.70 in the first example and $150 in the second example. Once we have a dollar amount, we can alert a contracted translator if the root of the non-conformity was poor performance on their part that we will be deducting these monetary losses from the purchase order that they were to be paid, thereby covering our losses.

Any organization will likely want to recuperate the monetary losses resulting from rework to the product when an external contractor is responsible for the non-conformities. (To determine if the external contractor is responsible, the project manager or a quality manager will first need to do a root cause analysis. More on that later in the next lesson.)

Here's where the terms and conditions that govern the work are important. We covered the terms and conditions in Independent Contractor Agreements (ICAs) and Purchase Orders (POs) in [Week 4: Legal Language in Business](../unit2/week4/week4-overview.md).

> Contractor agrees to provide services in accordance to the Organization’s specifications, to complete all assignments previously accepted by Contractor and to have work reviewed by the Organization and/or an independent third party. If it is determined that Contractor has returned, in the Organization’s sole opinion, sub-standard, deficient, or incomplete work, the Organization has the right to withhold and/or reduce payment and to terminate the use of Contractors services.
>
> Terms & Conditions from ICA or PO

If an external contractor is responsible, the monetary losses suffered due to the non-conforming product that they delivered can be recovered by reducing the payment that the organization agreed to pay for the contractor’s services. Reducing the payment can be safely done if the terms and conditions within the Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) or the Purchase Order (PO) identified reduced payments as a consequence of non-conforming deliveries. 

The contractor should be issues a new PO as quickly as possible in which the payment reduction is reflected, and the project manager should explain why the payment was reduced and the methodology used to determine the amount of the reduction.

### We have a non-conforming product. Now what?
