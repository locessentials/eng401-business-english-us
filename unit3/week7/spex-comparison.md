# A Comparison of Specifications

In this set of activities we'll dive a little bit deeper into the topic of specifications, focusing on the structure, terminology, linguistic conventions followed in this text type. We'll start by studying an example of standards-based translation specifications, and then you'll find an example set of specifications for a specific industry besides translation.

## Learning Objectives:

By the end of these activities, you will be able to:

- Understand how specifications are organized
- Identify important requirements to define in translation specifications
- Navigate the ASTM F2575 international standard on translation
- Bring awareness of language industry standards to your professional translation work

## Translation Specifications

The next page of our course website presents the example of [Tranquality's Standards-Based Structured Translation Specifications](https://www.tranquality.info/specs). This set of specifications was developed based on an important standard in the language services industry: [ASTM F2575: Standard Practice for Language Translation](https://store.astm.org/f2575-23e02.html).

In the activities that follow, we work with each of these resources.

### Part 1: Meet the Text

Go to the next page, and review the translation specifications there. As you review, answer the questions outline below. Please surface questions and doubts to the class.

**Questions for Consideration**

- What structure does the document follow?
- Is any of the terminology used within unclear to you? (If so, please research the terms or ask the instructor about them.)
- Who would you need to consult with to establish the specifications defined in the document?
- How would you go about filling out these specifications?
- What challenges might you encounter as you do so?

### Part 2: ASTM F2575 Standard Practice for Language Translation

As you read above, the specifications form you just reviewed was developed based on the international standard called ASTM F2575 Standard Practice for Language Translation. A [copy of that standard](https://universidaduic.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/TR35-BusinessEnglishII-2026-1/ERZgz7DXBA9CjEOFfkwxtrsBSyMOUuDpPmE-0dnN9N6C9A?e=qggyMR) has been shared with you privately for educational use with permission from ASTM International. Please do not share this resource outside of the class. 

*Note: Any instructors who are interested in teaching ASTM F2575 in an educational setting can reach out to Alaina Brandt for help securing a copy.*

We'll follow a *divide and conquer* approach to understanding this standard. You'll work in teams to review a specific section of the standard and then share what you've learned to our Specifications channel 

### Activity 1 - Topics Covered by Technical Specifications

What topics do specifications cover? To answer that question, we can find some examples of technical specifications written by a standards body like ASTM International. We'll get an idea of the breadth of coverage of specifications through a class poll.

**Poll Everywhere:** [pollev.com/alainabrandt831](pollev.com/alainabrandt831)

1. Navigate to the [ASTM International website](https://www.astm.org) and do a search of the word "specifications".
2. Find an example of a set of specifications that covers a topic that interests you.
3. Respond to the survey on Poll Everywhere, answering these questions:
  - What specific specifications document did you explore?
  - What does the specification cover?
  - What do you notice about the specialized terminology and/or linguistic conventions used in the discussion of the specifications?
  
Please be sure to include your name in your response on Poll Everywhere.
  
### Activity 2 - Technical Precision

ASTM International's publication "[Form and Style for ASTM Standards](https://store.astm.org/media/pdf/bluebook_FormStyle.pdf)" (AKA the "Blue Book") presents the rules that must be followed when writing international standards. We'll explore this resource via another poll to understand some of the rules that must be followed when writing specifications for ASTM International.

1. Review part B of the document: "Form of ASTM Specifications"
2. Pick a section that you find to be important to keep in mind when writing specifications.
3. Respond to the survey on Poll Everywhere, answering these questions:
  - What section did you concentrate on?
  - What does that section cover?
  - What did you learn from reviewing that section?

## Connections and Reflection

### Connecting What We've Covered to This Week's Activities

Your assignment for this week is to write a set of specifications for the production of a product or service. You won't need to meet the precision required for an international standard, but still the topics covered here are crucial for understanding the text type of specifications.

### Reflect on What You've Learned

As you work through the materials on specifications, reflect on these questions:

- How can specifications benefit you in your everyday work?
- In the domain of translation and localization, how would you contribute to specifications in various production roles?
- What strategies can you follow to establish effective specifications in your work?
