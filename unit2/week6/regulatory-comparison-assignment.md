### Step 2: Research Key Mexican Business Regulation

Identify **one specific regulation** that significantly affects your chosen company's industry in Mexico. Focus on a single, well-defined regulatory requirement rather than trying to cover all regulations for the industry.

- Organic certification procedures under SENASICA

### Step 3: Research Corresponding U.S. Regulation

Find the equivalent or comparable regulation that governs the same business activity in the United States.

### Step 4: Develop Recommendations

Based on your regulatory comparison, determine what recommendations you would make to help the company navigate the differences between U.S. and Mexican requirements.

### Step 5: Write Your Report

Follow the report format outlined below to create a professional consulting document.
