## Class Glossary Instructions

### Your Task
1. **Choose your focus:** Select either Balance Sheet OR Income Statement
2. **Deep dive:** Study your chosen statement using the resources provided
3. **Contribute to glossary:** Add 3-5 key terms to the appropriate class glossary tab
4. **Learn from others:** Review classmates' contributions to the other statement type

**Note:** The specific glossary tabs (Balance Sheet and Income Statement) will be shared as separate collaborative documents for real-time class contributions.

### Glossary Format

For each term you contribute, use this structure:

| **Field** | **Your Entry** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Contributor(s)** | [Your names] |
| **Head Term** | [Main terminology] |
| **Synonyms** | [Alternative terms, if any] |
| **Definition** | [Clear, concise explanation] |
| **Business Context Example** | [Sentence showing term in professional use] |
| **Questions and Research** | [What doubts did you have? What research did you do to resolve them>] |
| **Reflection on translation challenges** | [Analysis of potential challenges in understanding, connotation, regional variation, false friends, financial implications, etc.] |
| **Source Consulted** | [Where you found/verified the information you shared] |

### Example Glossary Entry

| **Field** | **Example Entry** |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Head Term** | Accounts Receivable |
| **Synonyms** | Trade receivables, Customer receivables |
| **Definition** | Money owed to a company by its customers for goods or services delivered but not yet paid for |
| **Business Context Example** | "Our accounts receivable increased by 15% this quarter, indicating either growing sales or potential collection issues that management should monitor." |
| **Questions and Research** | Initially confused this with accounts payable. Researched the difference: receivable = money coming TO us, payable = money going FROM us. |
| **Reflection on translation challenges** | In Spanish: "cuentas por cobrar" - careful not to confuse with "cuentas por pagar." Regional variations exist: Mexico uses "clientes" while Spain might prefer "deudores comerciales." Legal implications differ by country regarding collection practices. |
| **Source Consulted** | Harvard Business School Online, Investopedia |

### Class Discussion Points

After completing the glossary, we'll discuss:

- **Overlapping concepts:** Which terms appear in both statements?
- **Context variations:** How does terminology meaning shift between documents?
- **Translation challenges:** What cultural or legal considerations emerged?
- **Professional applications:** When would you encounter these terms in business communication?
