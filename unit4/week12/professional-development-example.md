# Professional Development Training Example

Welcome to the First-Time Managers Training Academy! You've been identified as a key performer who would make a great manager. We're here to help you to suceed on your journey. This training exercise for first-time managers will help you get experience with one-on-one and employeee development planning conversations.

Working in partners, take turns being the manager and the employee discussing career goals. Start with a general one-on-one in which you discuss what you're working on this week, what's going well and any blockers that are keeping you from accomplishing your tasks. Then move on to discussing your performance development plans.

## One-on-One Q&A 

**If you are playing the employee,** respond to these agenda items:

- What are you working on this week?
- For the major projects you are working on, what stage are they in?
- Is there anything that is blocking you from moving forward on projects with close deadlines?

Remember, providing a great deal of detail may not necessarily help your manager give better recommendations. Try to be targeted when answering these questions.

**If you are playing the manager:**

- Listen attentively.
- Ask questions that will help the person to think through potential solutions to issues they are encountering.
- Offer suggestions about gaps in thinking that may be preventing the person from moving forward on their work.
- Suggest resources that may help the person keep their work moving forward.
- Recognize when the person just needs to vent, and you need to take no action.
- Offer encouragement.

Remember, providing effective feedback sometimes relies on listening more, speaking less, and helping a person come to their own conclusions about work matters.
