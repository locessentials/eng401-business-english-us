# Assignment: Cross-Border Regulatory Comparison Report

**Worth:** 3 points

**Format:** Individual or group work

## Overview

You just reviewed an example of a Cross-Border Regulatory Comparison Report for the U.S. and Mexico in the realm of tech companies. Now you'll create your own report as a consultant to a U.S. organization wanting to enter the Mexican market.

You've been approached by a U.S. company seeking to expand into Mexico. They've asked you to prepare a report identifying the key regulations that impact international trade in their industry and provide recommendations for their market entry strategy.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Choose Your Client Company

Select one real company from the industry categories below. Each group must choose a different company. The company should be one that operates primarily in another country (not Mexico) and would benefit from entering the Mexican market.

| **Industry Category** | **Description** | **Primary Regulatory Considerations** |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Agriculture** | Agricultural products, farming equipment, and biotechnology solutions | Pesticide regulations, food safety standards, environmental compliance, biotechnology approvals |
| **Food & Beverage** | Processed foods, beverages, and nutritional supplements | Food safety certifications, labeling requirements, import/export licenses, health claims validation |
| **E-commerce** | Online retail platforms and digital marketplaces | Consumer protection laws, data privacy regulations, cross-border taxation, digital services compliance |
| **Fintech/Digital Payments** | Digital payment processing, mobile banking, and financial technology services | Financial services licensing, anti-money laundering regulations, data protection, consumer financial protection |
| **Textiles & Clothing** | Apparel manufacturing, fashion retail, and textile production | Labor standards compliance, supply chain transparency, textile safety regulations, trade agreements |
| **Cosmetics & Personal Care** | Beauty products, skincare, and personal hygiene items | Product safety testing, ingredient restrictions, marketing claims verification, cosmetic regulations |
| **Travel & Tourism** | Travel agencies, hospitality services, and tourism platforms | Travel licensing, consumer protection, health and safety standards, international travel regulations |
| **Healthcare** | Medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare services | Drug approval processes, medical device certifications, healthcare licensing, patient data protection |
| **Education** | Educational technology, online learning platforms, and educational services | Student data privacy, professional accreditation, accessibility compliance, international education standards |
| **Renewable Energy** | Solar, wind, and clean energy technology solutions | Environmental impact assessments, renewable energy incentives, electrical safety standards, professional licensing |

**How to choose your company**

- Pick an industry category that interests your group
- Research companies in that industry that operate in other countries but not yet in Mexico
- Choose a specific company that you can find regulatory information about
- Confirm that no other group has chosen the same company

### Step 2: Research Key Mexican Business Regulation

Identify **one specific regulation** that significantly affects your chosen company's industry in Mexico. Focus on a single, well-defined regulatory requirement rather than trying to cover all regulations for the industry.

**Examples of specific regulations:**
- COFEPRIS approval process for pharmaceutical imports
- NOM standards for electrical equipment safety
- CNBV licensing requirements for financial services
- Organic certification procedures under SENASICA

### Step 3: Research Corresponding U.S. Regulation

Find the equivalent or comparable regulation that governs the same business activity in the United States.

### Step 4: Develop Recommendations

Based on your regulatory comparison, determine what recommendations you would make to help the company navigate the differences between U.S. and Mexican requirements.

### Step 5: Write Your Report

Follow the report format outlined below to create a professional consulting document.
