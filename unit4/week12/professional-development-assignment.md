## Assignment Overview

Your assignment this week is to take on the role of people manager and to design **leadership training materials** that can be used to develop skills within different role. The materials you develop can be geared to training a people manager or to training the people manager's employees. You could create a role play with discussion questions, a template for a document that is necessary in employee management with instructions for use, or a guide on specific things related to people management that employees and managers should know. 

When selecting your topic and the media that is most appropriate for communicating about it, focus on specific skills you'd like to develop and ways of improving the people management experience for everyone.

Please get sign-off from the instructor on the topic you'll address and the text types you'll use.
