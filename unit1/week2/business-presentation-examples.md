## Activity: Analyzing Presentation Quality

### Step 1: Find Your Examples
Working individually and in small groups, find **two business presentations online**:

**Good sources to explore**
- TED Talks (business-focused)
- Company keynote presentations
- Industry conference presentations
- Business pitch competitions
- Corporate training videos

### Step 2: Evaluate Using Our Framework

**Rating Scale:** | EFFECTIVE | MOSTLY EFFECTIVE | SOMEWHAT INEFFECTIVE | INEFFECTIVE

**Evaluation Criteria**

**Content Organization**
- Clear structure and logical flow
- Strong opening and closing
- Main points are easy to follow

**Visual Design**
- Slides support (not distract from) the message  
- Appropriate use of images, charts, and text
- Professional and consistent design

**Delivery Style**

- Effective use of gestures and eye contact

**Audience Connection**
- Content relevant to audience needs
- Speaker responds to audience energy
- Call to action or clear takeaway

### Step 3: Share Your Analysis

**Prepare a brief report for Teams**
