## What Are "Herod Clauses"?

The term "Herod clause" refers to contract language that seems harmless but actually requires signers to give up something valuable—named after the biblical King Herod who ordered harmful actions against children.

### Listen: The Wi-Fi Firstborn Incident

**Listen to this segment from "A Way with Words" radio show:** [Herod Clause](https://waywordradio.org/herod-clause/)

A security firm in London set up a free Wi-Fi hotspot with terms and conditions that included language stating users agreed to "sign away their first born child for the duration of eternity." This was a stunt to demonstrate how people don't read terms and conditions—but some people actually agreed to these terms!

**Discussion Questions:**
- How often do you read terms and conditions before clicking "I agree"?
- What does this story reveal about our relationship with legal documents in daily life?
- How might this same principle apply to professional contracts?

## Real Contract Horror Stories

### Watch: Red Flags in Localization Contracts

**Watch this presentation about real problematic clauses encountered in the translation industry:** [Red Flags in Localization Contracts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shamGJQFAKA)

### Key Examples from the Video

**The Multiple Choice Question:**
If you had signed the Loc101 NDA from our previous activity, what rights would you have accidentally given up?

A. Freedom to work at another employer in the localization field
B. Ability to speak an idea aloud during an interview without your potential employer claiming rights to it  
C. Freedom from monetary damages for your work as an intern
D. Right to be paid for work performed
E. Full, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, and fully sublicensable right and license to use, reproduce, display, distribute, adapt, modify, create derivative works of, and otherwise commercially or non-commercially exploit in any way, any and all intellectual property

**Answer:** E - The intellectual property clause was the "Herod clause" hidden in the NDA.

### Real-World Contract Problems

**1. Non-Compete Agreements**
- Can prevent you from working in your field after leaving an employer
- May be legally unenforceable but can still create stress and uncertainty
- Often broader than necessary to protect legitimate business interests

**2. Interview IP Assignment**
- Some tech companies require signing agreements before interviews
- Any idea you mention during the interview becomes company property
- Creates unfair power dynamic in the hiring process

**3. Unlimited Liability for Interns**
- Student interns held responsible for "any and all debts, claims, demands, liabilities"
- Exposes students to financial risk far beyond their role or control
- Often added by lawyers without considering reasonableness

**4. Unpaid Additional Work Requirements**
- Purchase orders requiring "free in-context reviews" beyond paid translation work
- Terms buried in fine print, discovered only after work begins
- Can destroy professional relationships when translators discover hidden obligations

**5. Moral Rights Elimination**
- Translators routinely stripped of rights to be credited as creators of their work
- Translation treated as mere copying rather than creative, professional work
- Contradicts UN classification of translation as specialized professional activity

## The "Spaghetti at the Wall" Strategy

Contract lawyers often include as many restrictive clauses as possible, knowing most people won't challenge them. They rely on:

**Severability Clauses:** "If one part of this contract is found invalid, the rest still applies"
- Allows lawyers to include legally questionable terms
- Protects the overall contract even if some clauses are unenforceable
- Encourages overreaching in contract language

**Length and Complexity:** Making contracts so long and dense that people won't read them
- 2,600+ word "NDAs" that are actually comprehensive service agreements
- Important terms buried in dense legal language
- Multiple documents that must be read together to understand full obligations

## Industry Perspective: The Patenttranslator's Analysis

### Read: Professional Translator's Response

**Required Reading:** [How the So-Called Translation Industry Turned "Confidentiality Agreements" into Declarations of Acceptance of Servitude](https://patenttranslator.wordpress.com/2013/09/21/how-the-so-called-translation-industry-converted-confidentiality-agreements-into-declarations-of-acceptance-of-servitude/)

### Key Points from the Article and Comments

**Evolution of Translation Contracts**
- Traditional NDAs were 200-300 words, focused on actual confidentiality
- Modern "NDAs" can be 2,600+ words with extensive additional obligations
- Legitimate confidentiality protection has evolved into comprehensive control mechanisms

**Power Dynamics in the Industry**
- Large agencies can easily replace translators who refuse unfair terms
- Independent translators face "take it or leave it" contract terms
- Economic pressure forces acceptance of increasingly unreasonable conditions

**Professional Impact**
- Translators treated as "obedient servants" rather than skilled professionals
- Creative and professional aspects of translation work not recognized in contracts
- Industry-wide race to the bottom in professional standards

## Common Red Flags to Watch For

### 🚩 Intellectual Property Overreach
- **What to look for:** Broad assignments of rights to all your work, ideas, or creations
- **Red flag language:** "perpetual," "irrevocable," "all intellectual property," "derivative works"
- **Why it matters:** You could lose rights to work you create, even unrelated to the specific project

### 🚩 Unlimited Liability
- **What to look for:** Making you responsible for damages far beyond your control or role
- **Red flag language:** "any and all damages," "unlimited liability," "reasonable attorney's fees"
- **Why it matters:** You could face financial responsibility for problems you didn't cause

### 🚩 Unpaid Work Requirements
- **What to look for:** Obligations for additional work disguised as part of the original scope
- **Red flag language:** "as needed," "unlimited revisions," "additional services as required"
- **Why it matters:** You could end up working for free on time-consuming tasks

### 🚩 Overly Broad Non-Compete Clauses
- **What to look for:** Restrictions on working in your field that go beyond protecting legitimate business interests
- **Red flag language:** Long time periods, broad geographic areas, vague industry definitions
- **Why it matters:** Could prevent you from using your skills and education to earn a living

### 🚩 Invasive Monitoring Rights
- **What to look for:** Rights to audit your workspace, access your computer, or monitor your activities
- **Red flag language:** "from time to time," "ensure compliance," "workplace audits including home offices"
- **Why it matters:** Violates reasonable expectations of privacy and professional autonomy

### 🚩 Mandatory Compliance with Impossible Standards
- **What to look for:** Requirements that are technically impossible or unreasonably expensive to fulfill
- **Red flag language:** "delete all electronic files," "remove all traces," specific software requirements at your expense
- **Why it matters:** Sets you up for contract violations through no fault of your own

## Professional Responses to Unfair Contracts

### Successful Negotiation Examples

- **Research Legal Standards:** One professional faced a non-compete clause and researched Wisconsin employment law, finding that overly broad restrictions are unenforceable. Sharing the relevant statute with the employer resolved the issue.
- **Request Clarification:** When faced with unlimited liability clauses, asking employers to explain the risk they're asking you to assume often leads to contract modifications.
- **Seek Professional Advice:** For complex contracts or significant career decisions, consulting with a lawyer specializing in employment or contract law can provide valuable protection.

## Protection Strategies

### Before Signing Any Contract

**Essential Questions**
- What exactly am I agreeing to do and not do?
- What rights am I granting to the other party?
- What happens if something goes wrong?
- How long do my obligations last?
- What are the consequences if I need to terminate the agreement?

**Research Steps**
- Look up unfamiliar legal terms
- Check if similar clauses have been challenged in your jurisdiction
- Consider whether the terms are reciprocal (do both parties have similar obligations?)
- Ask trusted colleagues about their experiences with similar agreements

**Red Flag Responses**
- Request clarification for unclear or overly broad language
- Propose modifications to unreasonable terms
- Seek legal advice for contracts involving significant risk or long-term commitments
- Consider whether the opportunity is worth the risk of unfair terms
