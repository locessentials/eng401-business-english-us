# From Employee to Manager

Organizations sometimes like to promote from within rather go through a hiring process to fill roles that have opened. When they promote, it makes sense that they would promote a key performer within a team. A key performer who consistently meets or exceeds expectations may excel within production roles, but management requires a completely new set of skills. To keep key performers performing in management roles, training and development is necessary. This training and development is a piece that organizations sometimes miss. People get promotions for being good at their jobs and then are not taught how to be managers.

Not developing people into managers has profound impact on team performance. Within a U.S. context, it is often said that: 

> People don't jobs - they quit managers.

This page collects tips that can help new managers develop their people leading skills, so they can avoid becoming a manager that people want to quit. Specifically, this page covers the shift from employee to manager, one-on-one's and formal performance management documentation. These are three practical areas that new managers will need to navigate almost if not immediately.
