# Understanding Typical Contracts

**Time Investment:** 90-120 minutes of analysis and research

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this activity, you will be able to:
- Identify the three main types of contracts used in localization workflows
- Understand the purpose and key components of each contract type
- Recognize the difference between fair and exploitative contract terms
- Apply contract analysis skills to real-world professional documents

---

## Overview: The Contract Ecosystem

Translation and localization work between translators and agencies typically involves three types of contracts that work together to govern professional relationships.

### 1. Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

**Purpose:** Protects confidential information

**When signed:** First document, before any proprietary information is shared

**Key protection:** Client intellectual property and sensitive business information

### 2. Independent Contractor Agreement (ICA) / Service Agreement

**Purpose:** Defines the overall working relationship

**When signed:** After background checks, before beginning regular work

**Key areas:** Rights, responsibilities, intellectual property, quality standards

### 3. Purchase Order (PO) / Work Order

**Purpose:** Specifies terms for individual projects

**When signed:** For each new project or assignment

**Key details:** Scope, deadlines, payment, specific requirements

---

## Contract Analysis: Three Examples

### Example 1: Non-Disclosure Agreement

**Review the NDA from our [previous activity](class-nda.md)** - this is a example of an NDA used for educational purposes.

**Key Issues Identified**
- Transfers intellectual property rights from participants to organizer
- Uses educational context to obscure commercial terms
- "Perpetual" and "irrevocable" language typical of problematic agreements

### Example 2: Independent Contractor Agreement

**Based on [American Translators Association (ATA) model contract](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/ATA-ICA-Example.pdf) used until 2022**

**Professional Standards Included**
- References ATA Code of Ethics and Professional Practice
- Defines translation as skilled professional work requiring specialized knowledge
- Includes protections for translator's moral rights and copyright

**Fair Terms**
- Mutual indemnification (both parties protected equally)
- Right to decline assignments without penalty
- Payment not contingent on client paying the agency
- Reasonable quality assurance timeframes

**Areas for Negotiation**
- Payment terms (30 days vs. 45 days)
- Late payment fees
- Definition of confidential information
- Termination notice period

### Example 3: [Purchase Order](https://github.com/alainamb/uic_tr35-business-english-II/blob/main/unit2/week4/references/PO-Example.pdf)

**Project-specific document covering**
- Exact scope of work and deliverables
- Word counts and payment calculations
- Technical requirements and tools
- Quality assurance expectations

**Common Issues**
- Hidden additional work requirements
- Unclear invoicing procedures
- Penalty clauses for minor variations
- Technology requirements at contractor's expense

---

## Regional and Legal Context

### Mexican vs. US Contract Law

**Important Differences**
- **Contract Duration:** Mexican law requires service agreements to be at least 6 months to avoid employment classification issues
- **Moral Rights:** Mexican copyright law provides stronger protections for creators' moral rights than US law
- **Employment Classification:** Different standards for distinguishing contractors from employees

**Credit the Translator Movement**
Professional organizations worldwide advocate for:
- Recognition of translators' names on published works
- Protection of moral rights in translation contracts
- Fair compensation and professional treatment
- Resistance to exploitative industry practices

## Normalcy Bias in Contract Signing

### Understanding Why People Sign Without Reading

**Normalcy Bias** is the tendency to underestimate threats and assume that because others are doing something, it must be safe or normal.

**Emily Cipriani's Reflection on Signing the Loc101 NDA**
*"My sister was waiting at the doctor's office one day when the fire alarm went off. People looked around at each other, shrugged, and stayed in their chairs. A few minutes later, a doctor came out, saying, 'The alarm is beeping! You need to leave!' In the safety of a classroom, I fell under the influence of [Normalcy Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias); I wasn't on guard to notice the obvious warning signs, and when peers signed quickly, I did too."*

### Breaking the Normalcy Bias

**Professional Strategies**
- Always read contracts completely before signing
- Research unfamiliar terms and clauses
- Ask questions about unclear provisions
- Consider the long-term implications of what you're agreeing to
- Remember that you have the right to negotiate or decline

---

## Reflection: Would You Sign Now?

**Think back to our opening question from the NDA analysis:** Would you sign the Loc101 NDA knowing what you know now?

**Consider these factors:**
- The educational value of the seminar vs. the intellectual property rights you'd give up
- Your power to negotiate vs. the necessity of agreeing to participate
- Whether the surprise element of discovering the IP clause after signing was educational or manipulative
- How this experience might change your approach to future contract decisions

**Discussion Questions**
1. **How did normalcy bias influence your initial contract decision?**
2. **What warning signs do you now recognize that you missed before?**
3. **How might cultural expectations about authority and compliance affect contract-signing behavior?**
4. **What role does economic necessity play in professionals accepting unfair contract terms?**

## Contract Types Activity

**Your Goal:** Find and analyze a contract type we haven't covered in class.

### Step 1: Research Contract Types

**Look for examples of:**
- Employment contracts for in-house translators
- Freelance service agreements for direct clients
- Non-compete agreements in your region
- Copyright assignment agreements
- Partnership agreements between translation professionals
- Licensing agreements for translation tools or software
- Publishing contracts involving translation rights
- Any other professional agreement relevant to language services

### Step 2: Analyze Your Example

**For your chosen contract type, identify:**
- **Purpose:** What relationship or transaction does this contract govern?
- **Key Parties:** Who typically signs this type of agreement?
- **Critical Clauses:** What are the most important terms to understand?
- **Potential Issues:** What red flags should professionals watch for?
- **Regional Variations:** How might this contract type differ in Mexico vs. other countries?

### Step 3: Share Your Learning

**Post to Teams Contracts Channel:**

Create a brief analysis (300-500 words) that includes:

1. **Contract Type:** Name and brief description of the contract you researched
2. **Source:** Where you found your example (without violating anyone's confidentiality) - include a link or an attachment if possible
3. **Key Components:** Most important clauses and what they mean
4. **Professional Relevance:** How this contract type relates to translation/localization careers
5. **Red Flags:** Any concerning provisions you identified
6. **Recommendations:** What professionals should know before signing this type of agreement

**Example post format:**
*"I researched [type of contract] which is commonly used when [situation]. The most important clauses include [key terms]. Translation professionals should be particularly careful about [specific concerns] because [explanation]. If I were reviewing this type of contract, I would make sure to [specific recommendations]."*
