## Assignment Overview

Throughout Week 13, we've explored several types of international business documentation including Requests for Proposal (RFPs), Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), and Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, the landscape of international business documentation is vast, with many specialized document types serving specific purposes in commerce, contracting, procurement, and operations.

**Your deliverable will consist of two parts:**
1. A **1-2 page analysis** (one page preferred) explaining the document type
2. **Example documents** (at least one per group member) attached to your analysis

**Where to find examples:**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Form your group (if working collaboratively)

- You may work individually or in groups of up to **4 people**
- Coordinate with group members to select a document type of shared interest
- Assign responsibilities: who will find which examples, who will draft which sections, etc.

### Step 2: Select your document type

- Review the list of available document types
- Choose one that interests you or relates to your career goals
- Consider what examples might be available publicly before committing to a selection
- Verify your selection is not a document type already covered in class

### Step 3: Research and locate examples

- Find at least one authentic example per group member
- As you collect examples, take notes on:
  - Common structural elements you observe
  - Vocabulary that appears frequently
  - Variations between examples
  - What makes some examples clearer or more professional than others

**Research tips:**
- Search using specific document type names (e.g., "Statement of Work template," "Bill of Lading example")
- Look for industry-specific resources (project management organizations, logistics companies, etc.)
- Check government websites, which often have excellent examples of standardized documents
- Consider consulting the GSA eLibrary or similar procurement databases

### Step 4: Analyze your examples

Before writing, systematically analyze your collected examples:
- Create a table comparing structural elements across examples
- List vocabulary that appears in multiple examples
- Identify required vs. optional sections
- Note formatting conventions (use of tables, headers, numbered sections, etc.)

### Step 5: Write your analysis

Draft your 1-2 page analysis following the structure outlined above:
1. Explain the document's purpose and context
2. Describe its standard structure and components
3. Define key vocabulary and terminology
4. Share observations from comparing your examples

**Writing tips:**
- Be concise—focus on the most important and interesting information
- Use specific examples from the documents you found to illustrate points
- Write for an audience (your classmates) who understands business English but hasn't studied this document type
- Include a vocabulary table if that helps present terminology clearly

### Step 6: Format and compile your submission

Create one Word document containing:
1. **Title page** (optional but professional): Document type, group members' names, date
2. **Your analysis** (1-2 pages)
3. **Example documents** (attached after the analysis)
4. **Works consulted** (list where you found each example, can be a simple bulleted list)

Ensure professional formatting throughout with consistent fonts, spacing, and headers.
