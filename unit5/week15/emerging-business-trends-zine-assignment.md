## Assignment Overview

Throughout this semester, you've analyzed business communication, legal frameworks, quality systems, teamwork, and leadership. Now, in this final unit, we're exploring the buzzwords that dominate contemporary business discourse: "digital transformation," "innovation," "disruption," "sustainability," and "the future of work."

But rather than approaching these concepts through traditional business analysis, you'll contribute to a **class zine**—a creative, subversive publication format that encourages bold thinking and imaginative expression.

Your contribution should make a statement about business innovation, emerging trends, or the future of work. This assignment is intentionally more creative than previous assignments to encourage you to think beyond conventional business frameworks and imagine alternative possibilities.

All contributions will be compiled into our **TR35 Business English II Emerging Trends Zine**, showcasing the diverse perspectives of our class on where business is headed—and where it should go.

## What is a Zine?

A **[zine](https://guides.lib.purdue.edu/loudonpaper/what-is-a-zine#:~:text=Definition,to%20express%20the%20author%27s%20message.)** (short for "magazine" or "fanzine") is a small-circulation, self-published work of original or appropriated texts and images. Zines are typically produced through photocopying or digital printing and are often created to express the author's ideas, politics, or creative vision outside mainstream publishing channels.

**Key characteristics of zines:**
- **DIY aesthetic**: Handmade or independently produced quality
- **Limited distribution**: Created for specific communities or niche audiences
- **Creative freedom**: No editorial oversight or commercial constraints
- **Subversive potential**: Often challenge dominant narratives or conventional thinking
- **Diverse formats**: Can include writing, art, photography, collage, found text, or mixed media
- **Accessible creation**: Anyone can make a zine with basic materials

### Why Zines in Business Contexts?

While zines originated in countercultural movements, they offer valuable approaches for business communication:

- **Promoting creativity and experimentation:** Zines encourage unconventional thinking—the kind of creative, boundary-pushing mindset that drives genuine innovation rather than incremental improvement.
- **Reaching niche audiences:** Like specialized business publications or internal company newsletters, zines can speak directly to specific communities without worrying about mass appeal.
- **Encouraging bold thinking:** The zine format gives permission to make provocative statements, imagine radical alternatives, and challenge business-as-usual thinking that conventional business writing often discourages.
- **Being subversive when needed:** Zines have historically been used to question dominant narratives and propose alternatives. In business contexts, this translates to questioning "the way things have always been done" and imagining transformative change rather than superficial updates.
- **Fostering authentic expression:** The informal, personal nature of zines allows for genuine voice and perspective rather than the sanitized, corporate-approved messaging that characterizes much business communication.

## Inspiration: Imagining Possible Futures

This assignment is inspired by the Distributed AI Research Institute's [Imagining Possible Futures](https://www.dair-institute.org/imagining-possible-futures) workshop and zine project. DAIR brought together participants to envision alternative technological futures beyond the dominant narratives of Big Tech and venture capital.

**From the DAIR workshop description:**

> "Through our blog series, we are exploring what the world can look like when technology is designed and deployed for the benefit of all. These broad, near-future speculative pieces are designed to de-center dominant narratives and challenge us all to realize that things can be different. These are not alternative realities; they are possible futures."

**View the example:** [DAIR Possible Futures Zine Issue 1](references/DAIR_PossibleFuturesZine_Issue1.pdf)

This zine includes blackout poetry, manifestos, speculative scenarios, visual art, short fiction, and critical reflections—all centered on imagining technology futures that serve communities rather than corporations.

Your zine contribution will similarly invite you to imagine business futures that challenge conventional thinking about innovation, transformation, and the nature of work itself.

### Featured Formats (Detailed Guidance)

| Format | Description | What to Include | Tips for Success |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Blackout Poetry** | Take an existing business article (from Bloomberg, Harvard Business Review, Forbes, etc.) and black out words to create a poem that makes a point about business innovation | • Original article (cited properly)<br>• Words blacked out strategically to reveal new meaning<br>• Final poem that makes clear statement about business trends | • Choose articles with rich vocabulary<br>• Experiment with different patterns of redaction<br>• Your poem should subvert, critique, or reimagine the article's original message<br>• Consider what's hidden as well as what's revealed |
| **Mind Map or Visual Diagram** | Create a visual representation of concepts, frameworks, or relationships between business ideas | • Central concept or question<br>• Branching connections showing relationships<br>• Specific examples and details<br>• Visual hierarchy (size, color, placement) | • Hand-drawn and photographed OR created digitally<br>• Use the visual format to show complexity that's hard to express linearly<br>• Consider using the performative-to-authentic framework or other course concepts<br>• Make connections explicit with labels and arrows |
| **Speculative Business Scenario** | Describe a company, organization, or work arrangement that exists in a transformed business world (300-500 words) | • What the organization does and how it operates<br>• What problems it solves<br>• What makes it possible (technology, values, economic systems)<br>• Specific details about structure and relationships | • Focus on concrete details: What does a typical day look like?<br>• Show rather than tell: Use specific examples<br>• Make it feel real and tangible<br>• Consider: What would make your current business frustrations literally unthinkable in this world? |
| **Manifesto or Position Statement** | Write a bold, declarative statement about how business should operate, what innovation really means, or what the future of work should be (300-500 words) | • Clear thesis or position<br>• Supporting principles or arguments<br>• Specific examples of what this means in practice<br>• Call to action or vision for change | • Be provocative and specific<br>• Use strong, declarative language<br>• Don't hedge or qualify excessively<br>• Make concrete demands or proposals<br>• Consider what business "common sense" you're challenging |

### Other Creative Formats to Consider

If the featured formats don't suit your message, consider these alternatives:

- **Constraint-based writing** (exactly 205 characters about business in 2050, or a haiku series about digital transformation)
- **Found text poetry** from corporate annual reports, mission statements, or job postings
- **Visual-text combinations** (annotated screenshots, business model canvas with poetic text, meme-style commentary)
- **Timeline** showing the evolution from present problems to transformed futures
- **Interview or dialogue format** between different perspectives on business innovation
- **Letter from 2050** reflecting on today's business decisions
- **"Before/After" comparison** showing business transformation visually or through description
- **Rules or guidelines** for ethical innovation (presented creatively)
- **Critical analysis** of a buzzword or trend (250-400 words, but with creative presentation)
- **Experimental approaches you propose** (discuss with instructor first)

**Word count equivalents:** For visual or mixed-media formats, aim for complexity and substance equivalent to 200-400 words of written content.

## Assignment Instructions

### Step 1: Choose your topic and format

**Select a focus area:**
- Digital transformation (what it really means vs. what companies claim)
- Innovation (authentic vs. performative)
- Disruption (who benefits, who's harmed)
- ESG and sustainability (genuine commitment vs. greenwashing)
- Future of work (remote work, automation, changing employment relationships)
- Business technology (ethical implications, data practices)
- Or another emerging trend you've encountered this semester

**Choose your format:**
Review the featured formats and alternative options. Select the format that will most effectively convey your perspective on your chosen topic.

**Make it personal:**
You may further develop topics from your mini-presentations or earlier assignments, but the updates must be substantial and the creative format must offer new insights.

### Step 2: Research and develop your contribution

**For speculative or analytical pieces:**
- Review course materials from Week 15 on digital transformation, innovation, and emerging trends
- Research current examples of your topic (news articles, company announcements, industry reports)
- Identify what frustrates you about how this topic is typically discussed
- Imagine alternatives—what would a transformed approach look like?

**For creative or visual pieces:**
- Gather source materials (articles for blackout poetry, images for collages, etc.)
- Experiment with different approaches
- Focus on making your statement clear through your creative choices
- Consider how format and content work together to convey meaning

**For all formats:**
- Make sure your contribution makes a clear statement (even if that statement is questioning or subversive)
- Aim for substance—avoid generic observations or surface-level commentary
- Take creative risks—this is your opportunity to experiment with form and voice

- **Visual pieces:** If hand-drawn or physical, photograph with good lighting against plain background
- **Attribution:** Properly cite any sources used (for blackout poetry, found text, quotations, or referenced ideas)
- **Inclusive language:** Use language that doesn't assume masculine gender as neutral

### Step 4: Polish and submit

**Before submitting:**
- Proofread carefully (even creative work should be free of distracting errors)
- Ensure any sources are properly attributed
- Check that visual elements are clear and high-quality

3. How does the creative freedom of the zine format change what you're willing to say about business innovation and emerging trends?

4. If your contribution imagines an alternative future or critiques current practices, what specific business assumptions are you challenging?
