## Email Scenarios

Choose **one scenario per group** - no duplicates allowed. Each scenario requires thoughtful consideration of audience, tone, and purpose.

### Scenario 1: Project Delay Communication
You're a project manager and your team has encountered unexpected technical difficulties that will delay the product launch by 3 weeks. You need to inform your client about this delay while maintaining their confidence and proposing solutions.

**Key considerations:** Client relationship, accountability, solution-focused approach

### Scenario 2: Budget Increase Request
As a department head, you've discovered that your quarterly budget needs to increase by 15% due to rising material costs and expanded project scope. You must request additional funding from senior management.

**Key considerations:** Data-driven justification, cost-benefit analysis, timing sensitivity

### Scenario 3: Cross-Cultural Team Conflict Resolution
You're managing an international project team where communication styles have led to misunderstandings between team members in different countries. You need to address the situation diplomatically while establishing clearer communication protocols.

**Key considerations:** Cultural sensitivity, neutral tone, constructive solutions

### Scenario 4: Client Service Recovery
A major client has expressed dissatisfaction with your company's recent service delivery. Quality issues have affected their business operations, and they're considering switching to a competitor. You need to respond to their complaint email.

**Key considerations:** Accountability, service recovery, relationship preservation

### Scenario 5: Vendor Contract Renegotiation
Your company's primary supplier has notified you of significant price increases effective next quarter. You need to respond by proposing alternative arrangements or renegotiating terms while maintaining the business relationship.

**Key considerations:** Negotiation strategy, mutual benefit, professional assertiveness

### Scenario 6: Internal Process Change Announcement
As operations director, you need to announce a significant change to established work procedures that will affect all departments. Some employees are likely to resist the change, but it's necessary for regulatory compliance.

**Key considerations:** Change management, clear rationale, implementation support

## Group Work Process

### Step 1: Group Formation & Scenario Selection (5 minutes)

### Step 2: Collaborative Email Drafting  (25 minutes)
Work collaboratively to craft your email response, considering:
- **Subject line** that clearly communicates purpose
- **Opening** that establishes context appropriately

- **Signature** that communicates who you are
- **Tone** that matches the situation and audience

```

## The Peer Review

Your completed email drafts will be evaluated by your peers using following the methodology outlined [on the next page](email-peer-review.md). Consider these evaluation criteria as you draft and review your emails:

- **Completeness of Information**
- **Professional Formatting**
- **Effectiveness in Achieving Purpose**

### Success Tips

Do a sanity check of the emails to ensure they meet these guidelines:

- **Be specific and concrete** rather than vague
- **Consider your reader's perspective** and likely questions
- **Balance professionalism with human connection**
- **Proofread carefully** for clarity and correctness
- **Test your message** - would you understand it as the recipient?
